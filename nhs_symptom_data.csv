allergies,"An allergy is a reaction the body has to a particular food or substance. Allergies are very common. They're thought to affect more than 1 in 4 people in the UK at some point in their lives. They are particularly common in children. Some allergies go away as a child gets older, although many are lifelong. Adults can develop allergies to things they weren't previously allergic to. Having an allergy can be a nuisance and affect your everyday activities, but most allergic reactions are mild and can be largely kept under control. Severe reactions can occasionally occur, but these are uncommon. Substances that cause allergic reactions are called allergens. The more common allergens include: Most of these allergens are generally harmless to people who aren't allergic to them. Allergic reactions usually happen quickly within a few minutes of exposure to an allergen. They can cause: Most allergic reactions are mild, but occasionally a severe reaction called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock can occur. This is a medical emergency and needs urgent treatment. Read more about the symptoms of allergies. If you have allergies you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory. If your pharmacist thinks you might have a mild allergy, they can offer advice and treatment to help manage the condition. See your pharmacist if you think you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something. The symptoms of an allergic reaction can also be caused by other conditions. Your pharmacist can help determine whether it's likely you have an allergy. If your allergy is particularly severe or it's not clear what you're allergic to, the pharmacist may advise you see your GP who may refer you to an allergy specialist for testing and advice about treatment. Read more about allergy testing. In many cases, the most effective way of managing an allergy is to avoid the allergen that causes the reaction whenever possible. For example, if you have a food allergy, you should check a food's ingredients list for allergens before eating it. The Food Standards Agency has more information about food allergen labelling. There are also several medications available to help control symptoms of allergic reactions, including: For some people with very severe allergies, a treatment called immunotherapy may be recommended. This involves being exposed to the allergen in a controlled way over a number of years, so your body gets used to it and doesn't react to it so severely. Read more about treating an allergy and avoiding allergic reactions. Allergies occur when the body's immune system reacts to a particular substance as though it's harmful. It's not clear why this happens, but most people affected have a family history of allergies or have closely related conditions such as asthma or eczema. The number of people with allergies is increasing every year. The reasons for this are not understood, but one of the main theories is it's the result of living in a cleaner, germ-free environment, which reduces the number of germs our immune system has to deal with. It's thought this may cause it to overreact when it comes into contact with harmless substances. Symptoms of an allergic reaction usually develop within a few minutes of being exposed to something you're allergic to, although occasionally they can develop gradually over a few hours. Although allergic reactions can be a nuisance and hamper your normal activities, most are mild. Very occasionally, a severe reaction called anaphylaxis can occur. Common symptoms of an allergic reaction include: The symptoms vary depending on what you're allergic to and how you come into contact with it. For example, you may have a runny nose if exposed to pollen, develop a rash if you have a skin allergy, or feel sick if you eat something you're allergic to. See your pharmacist if you or your child might have had an allergic reaction to something. They can help determine whether the symptoms are caused by an allergy or another condition. Read more about diagnosing allergies. In rare cases, an allergy can lead to a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock, which can be life-threatening. This affects the whole body and usually develops within minutes of exposure to something you're allergic to. Signs of anaphylaxis include any of the symptoms above, as well as: Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Read more about anaphylaxis for information about what to do if it occurs. If you think you have an allergy, tell your pharmacist about the symptoms you're having, when they happen, how often they occur and if anything seems to trigger them. Your pharmacist can offer advice and treatment for mild allergies with a clear cause. If your allergy is more severe or it's not obvious what you're allergic to, your pharmacist may advise you to see your GP as you may need referred for allergy testing at a specialist allergy clinic. The tests that may be carried out are described below. Skin prick testing is one of the most common allergy tests. It involves putting a drop of liquid onto your forearm that contains a substance you may be allergic to. The skin under the drop is then gently pricked with a needle. If you are allergic to the substance, an itchy, red bump will appear within 15 minutes. Skin prick testing is painless and very safe. Make sure you don't take antihistamines before the test, as they can interfere with the results. Blood tests may be used instead of, or alongside, skin prick tests to help diagnose common allergies. A sample of your blood is removed and analysed for specific antibodies produced by your immune system in response to an allergen. Patch tests are used to investigate a type of eczema known as contact dermatitis, which can be caused by your skin being exposed to an allergen. A small amount of the suspected allergen is added to special metal discs, which are then taped to your skin for 48 hours and monitored for a reaction. If you have a suspected food allergy, you may be advised to avoid eating a particular food to see if your symptoms improve. After a few weeks, you may then be asked to eat the food again to check if you have another reaction. Don't attempt to do this yourself without discussing it with a qualified healthcare professional. In a few cases, a test called a food challenge may also be used to diagnose a food allergy. During the test, you're given the food you think you're allergic to in gradually increasing amounts, to see how you react under close supervision. This test is riskier than other forms of testing, as it could cause a severe reaction, but is the most accurate way to diagnose food allergies. And challenge testing is always carried out in a clinic where a severe reaction can be treated if it does develop. The treatment for an allergy depends on what you're allergic to. In many cases your pharmacist will be able to offer advice and treatment. They'll advise you about taking steps to avoid exposure to the substance you're allergic to, and can recommend medication to control your symptoms. The best way to keep your symptoms under control is often to avoid the things you're allergic to, although this isn't always practical. For example, you may be able to help manage: Read more about preventing allergic reactions. Medications for mild allergies are available from pharmacies on the Pharmacy First Scotland service without a prescription, but always ask your pharmacist for advice before starting any new medicine, as they're not suitable for everyone. Antihistamines are the main medicines for allergies. They can be used: Antihistamines can be taken as tablets, capsules, creams, liquids, eye drops or nasal sprays, depending on which part of your body is affected by your allergy. Decongestants can be used as a short-term treatment for a blocked nose caused by an allergic reaction. They can be taken as tablets, capsules, nasal sprays or liquids. Don't use them for more than a week at a time, as using them for long periods can make your symptoms worse. Red and itchy skin caused by an allergic reaction can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter creams and lotions, such as: Steroid medications can help reduce inflammation caused by an allergic reaction. They're available as: Sprays, drops and weak steroid creams are available without a prescription. Stronger creams, inhalers and tablets are available on prescription from your GP. Immunotherapy may be an option for a small number of people with certain severe and persistent allergies who are unable to control their symptoms using the measures above. The treatment involves being given occasional small doses of the allergen either as an injection, or as drops or tablets under the tongue over the course of several years. The injection can only be performed in a specialist clinic under the supervision of a doctor, as there is a small risk of a severe reaction. The drops or tablets can usually be taken at home. The aim of treatment is to help your body get used to the allergen so it doesn't react to it so severely. This won't necessarily cure your allergy, but it will make it milder and mean you can take less medication. Some people with severe allergies may experience life-threatening reactions, known as anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock. If you're at risk of this, you'll be given special injectors containing a medicine called adrenaline to use in an emergency. If you develop symptoms of anaphylaxis, such as difficulty breathing, you should inject yourself in the outer thigh before seeking emergency medical help. Read more about the treating anaphylaxis. The best way to prevent an allergic reaction is to avoid the substance that you're allergic to, although this isn't always easy or practical. Below is some practical advice that should help you avoid the most common allergens. One of the biggest causes of allergies are dust mites, which are tiny insects found in household dust. You can limit the number of mites in your home by: Concentrate your efforts of controlling dust mites in the areas of your home where you spend the most time, such as the bedroom and living room. You can find more information on allergies in the home on the Allergy UK website. It's not the pet fur that causes an allergic reaction. Instead, it's flakes of their dead skin, saliva and dried urine. If you can't permanently remove a pet from the house, you could try: If you're visiting a friend or relative with a pet, ask them not to dust or vacuum on the day you're visiting, as this will stir up the allergens into the air. Taking an antihistamine medicine about an hour before entering a pet-inhabited house can also help reduce your symptoms. The Allergy UK website has more information about domestic pet allergies. Tiny particles released by moulds can cause an allergic reaction in some people. You can help prevent this by: By law, food manufacturers must clearly label any foods that contain something that's known to cause allergic reactions in some people. By carefully checking the label for the list of ingredients, you should be able to avoid an allergic reaction. People with food allergies most often experience an allergic reaction while eating out at a restaurant. You can avoid this by: Remember, simple dishes are less likely to contain ""hidden"" ingredients. If you're not sure about a dish, dont risk it Read more about living with a food allergy and advice from the Food Standards Agency on food allergen labelling. Pollen allergies more commonly known as hay fever are caused when trees and grasses release pollen into the air. Doctors often call hay fever allergic rhinitis. Different plants pollinate at different times of the year, so the months that you get hay fever will depend on what sort of pollen(s) you are allergic to. Typically, people are affected during spring (trees) and summer (grasses). To help keep your hay fever under control, you can: If you've ever suffered a bad reaction to an insect bite or sting, it's important to take precautions to minimise your risk. When you're outdoors, particularly in the summer, you could: Read more about preventing insect bites and stings. If you're at risk of experiencing a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), make sure you carry two adrenaline auto-injectors with you everywhere. Wearing a MedicAlert or Medi-Tag medallion or bracelet can make others aware of your allergy in an emergency. Consider telling your teachers, work colleagues and friends, so they can give you your adrenaline injection in an emergency, while waiting for an ambulance. Read more about preventing anaphylaxis."

bowel-incontinence,"Bowel incontinence is an inability to control bowel movements, resulting in involuntary soiling. It's also sometimes known as faecal incontinence. The experience of bowel incontinence can vary from person to person. Some people feel a sudden need to go to the toilet but are unable to reach a toilet in time. This is known as urge bowel incontinence. Other people experience no sensation before soiling themselves, known as passive incontinence or passive soiling, or there might be slight soiling when passing wind. Some people experience incontinence on a daily basis, whereas for others it only happens from time to time. It's thought 1 in 10 people will be affected by it at some point in their life. It can affect people of any age, although it's more common in elderly people. It's also more common in women than men. Bowel incontinence is a symptom of an underlying problem or medical condition. Many cases are caused by diarrhoea, constipation, or weakening of the muscle that controls the opening of the anus. It can also be caused by long-term conditions such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis and dementia. Read more about the causes of bowel incontinence. Bowel incontinence can be upsetting and hard to cope with, but treatment is effective and a cure is often possible, so make sure you see your GP. It's important to remember that: If you don't want to see your GP, you can usually make an appointment at your local NHS continence service without a referral. These clinics are staffed by specialist nurses who can offer useful advice about incontinence. Read more about diagnosing bowel incontinence. In many cases, with the right treatment, a person can maintain normal bowel function throughout their life. Treatment will often depend on the cause and how severe it is, but possible options include: Incontinence products, such as anal plugs and disposable pads, can be used until your symptoms are better controlled. Even if it isn't possible to cure your bowel incontinence, symptoms should improve significantly. Read more about treating bowel incontinence. Bowel incontinence is usually caused by a physical problem with the parts of the body that control the bowel. The most common problems are: These problems are explained in more detail below. It's important to discuss any bowel problems with your GP as there's a small chance they could be a sign of a more serious condition, such as bowel cancer. Constipation is a leading cause of bowel incontinence. In cases of severe constipation, a large, solid stool can become stuck in the rectum. This is known as faecal impaction. The stool then begins to stretch the muscles of the rectum, weakening them. Watery stools can leak around the stool and out of the bottom, causing bowel incontinence. This is called overflow incontinence and happens most commonly in elderly people. Repeated straining caused by constipation or faecal impaction can also lead to rectal prolapse, when part of your lower intestine falls out of place and protrudes from your bottom. Rectal prolapse may also lead to bowel incontinence. It's difficult for the rectum to hold liquid stools (diarrhoea), so people with diarrhoea (particularly recurring diarrhoea) can develop bowel incontinence. Conditions that can cause recurring diarrhoea include: These conditions can also cause scarring of the rectum, which can lead to bowel incontinence. Haemorrhoids (piles) are enlarged blood vessels inside or around the bottom (the rectum and anus). Symptoms include discomfort, itching, bleeding or a lump hanging down outside of the anus. In severe cases, haemorrhoids may lead to bowel incontinence. The sphincter muscles at the bottom of the rectum control the bowel. Bowel incontinence happens if these muscles become weakened or damaged. Childbirth is a common cause of damage to the sphincter muscles and a leading cause of bowel incontinence. During a vaginal birth, the sphincter muscles can become stretched and damaged, particularly as a result of a forceps delivery. Other causes include a large baby, the baby being born with the back of their head facing the mother's back (occipitoposterior position) and a long labour. Sphincter muscles can also become damaged through injury, or damage from bowel or rectal surgery. Bowel incontinence can also be caused by a problem with the nerves connecting the brain and the rectum. A nerve problem can mean your body is unaware of stools in your rectum, and may make it difficult for you to control your sphincter muscles. Damage to these nerves is related to a number of conditions, including: An injury to these nerves, such as a spinal injury, can also lead to bowel incontinence. In some cases, bowel incontinence may result from a health condition such as dementia or a severe learning disability that causes the person to lose bowel control. A physical disability can also make it difficult to get to the toilet in time. Your GP will begin by asking you about the pattern of your symptoms and other related issues, such as your diet. You may find this embarrassing, but it's important to answer as honestly and fully as you can to make sure you receive the most suitable treatment. Let your doctor know about: Your GP will usually carry out a physical examination. They'll look at your anus and the surrounding area to check for damage and carry out a rectal examination, inserting a gloved finger into your bottom. A rectal examination will show whether constipation is the cause, and check for any tumours in your rectum. Your GP may ask you to squeeze your rectum around their finger to assess how well the muscles in your anus are working. Depending on the results, your GP may refer you for further tests. During an endoscopy, the inside of your rectum (and in some cases your lower bowel) is examined using a long, thin flexible tube with a light and video camera at the end (endoscope). Images can also be taken of the inside of your body. The endoscope checks whether there's any obstruction, damage or inflammation in your rectum. An endoscopy isn't painful, but it can feel uncomfortable, so you may be given a sedative to relax you. Anal manometry helps to assess how well the muscles and nerves in and around your rectum are working. The test uses a device that looks like a small thermometer with a balloon attached to the end. It's inserted into your rectum and the balloon is inflated. It may feel unusual, but it's not uncomfortable or painful. The device is attached to a machine, which measures pressure readings taken from the balloon. You'll be asked to squeeze, relax and push your rectum muscles at certain times. You may also be asked to push the balloon out of your rectum in the same way you push out a stool. The pressure-measuring machine gives an idea of how well your muscles are working. If the balloon is inflated to a relatively large size but you don't feel any sensation of fullness, it may mean there are problems with the nerves in your rectum. An ultrasound scan can be used to create a detailed picture of the inside of your anus. Ultrasound scans are particularly useful in detecting underlying damage to the sphincter muscles. Defecography is a test used to study how you pass stools. It can also be useful in detecting signs of obstruction or prolapse that haven't been discovered during a rectal examination. During this test, a liquid called barium is placed into your rectum. The barium helps make it easier to highlight problems using an X-ray. Once the barium is in place, you'll be asked to pass stools in the usual way while scans are taken. This test is occasionally carried out using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner instead of an X-ray. Treatment for bowel incontinence depends on underlying cause and the pattern of your symptoms. Trying the least intrusive treatments first, such as dietary changes and exercise programmes, is often recommended. Medication and surgery are usually only considered if other treatments haven't worked. The various treatments for bowel incontinence are outlined below. You may find it helpful to use continence products until your bowel incontinence is better controlled. Most continence products are available for free on the NHS. Anal plugs are one way to prevent involuntary soiling. An anal plug is made of foam and designed to be inserted into your bottom. However, they can be uncomfortable and they're not really a long term solution. If the plug comes into contact with moisture from the bowel, it expands and prevents leakage or soiling. Anal plugs can be worn for up to 12 hours, after which time they are removed using an attached string. Disposable body pads are contoured pads that soak up liquid stools and protect your skin. They can be used in cases of mild bowel incontinence. Single-use silicone inserts, which form a seal around the rectum until your next bowel movement, are also being investigated as a treatment option for moderate to severe bowel incontinence. Your local NHS continence service can offer help and advice about continence products, and you don't usually need a referral from your GP to make an appointment. These clinics are staffed by nurses who specialise in continence treatment. Bowel incontinence associated with diarrhoea or constipation can often be controlled by making changes to your diet. It may be beneficial to keep a food diary to record the effect of your diet on your symptoms. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has published dietary advice for managing diarrhoea in cases of irritable bowel syndrome. These guidelines can also be applied to people with diarrhoea associated with bowel incontinence. The advice from NICE includes the following: A high-fibre diet is usually recommended for most people with constipation-associated bowel incontinence. Your GP can tell you if a high-fibre diet is suitable for you. Fibre can soften stools, making them easier to pass. Foods that are high in fibre include: Drink plenty of fluids because this can help to soften your stools and make them easier to pass. Pelvic floor muscle training is a type of exercise programme used to treat cases of bowel incontinence caused by weakness in the pelvic floor muscles. A therapist, usually a physiotherapist or specialist nurse, will teach you a range of exercises. The goal of pelvic floor muscle training is to strengthen any muscles that may have been stretched and weakened. You'll probably be required to carry out the exercises 3 times a day, for 6 to 8 weeks. After this time, you should notice an improvement in your symptoms. Check with your health professional before trying these at home. First, pretend you're trying to hold in a bowel movement. You should feel the muscles around your anus tighten. Next, sit, stand, or lie in a comfortable position with your legs slightly apart. If you find these exercises too difficult, try fewer repetitions at first and build them up. If they get too easy, try doing more repetitions. You can do the exercises without anyone knowing about them, so they should be easy to fit into your daily routine. Bowel retraining is a type of treatment for people with reduced sensation in their rectum as a result of nerve damage, or for those who have recurring episodes of constipation. There are 3 goals in bowel retraining: Changes to your diet usually improve stool consistency (see above). Establishing a regular time to empty your bowels means finding the most convenient time when you can go to the toilet without being rushed. Ways to stimulate bowel movements can differ from person to person. Some people find a hot drink and meal can help. Others may need to stimulate their anus using their finger. Biofeedback is a type of bowel retraining exercise that involves placing a small electric probe into your bottom. The sensor relays detailed information about the movement and pressure of the muscles in your rectum to an attached computer. You're then asked to perform a series of exercises designed to improve your bowel function. The sensor checks that you are performing the exercises in the right way. Medication can be used to help treat soft or loose stools or constipation associated with bowel incontinence. Loperamide is a medicine widely used to treat diarrhoea. It works by slowing down the movement of stools through the digestive system, allowing more water to be absorbed from the stools. Loperamide can be prescribed in low doses to be taken regularly over a long period of time. Laxatives are used to treat constipation. They're a type of medicine that helps you to pass stools. Bulk-forming laxatives are usually recommended. These help your stools to retain fluid. This means they're less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction. Rectal irrigation or enemas are used when bowel incontinence is caused by faecal impaction and other treatments have failed to remove the impacted stool from the rectum. These procedures involve a small tube that is placed into your anus. A special solution is then used to wash out your rectum. Surgery is usually only recommended after all other treatment options have been tried. The main surgical treatments used on the NHS are sphincteroplasty and sacral nerve stimulation. Other treatments such as tibial nerve stimulation, endoscopic heat therapy and artificial sphincter surgery can also be used, but their availability on the NHS is limited. An operation called a colostomy is more widely available on the NHS, but it's only used if other treatments are unsuccessful. These treatments are outlined in more detail below. A sphincteroplasty is an operation to repair damaged sphincter muscles. The surgeon removes some of the muscle tissue and the muscle edges are overlapped and sewn back together. This provides extra support to the muscles, which makes them stronger. Sacral nerve stimulation is a treatment used for people with weakened sphincter muscles. Electrodes are inserted under the skin in the lower back and connected to a pulse generator. The generator releases pulses of electricity that stimulate the sacral nerves, which causes the sphincter and pelvic floor muscles to work more effectively. At first, the pulse generator is located outside your body. If the treatment is effective, the pulse generator will be implanted deep under the skin in your back. The most commonly reported complications of the procedure are infection at the site of surgery and technical problems with the pulse generator, which require additional surgery to correct. See the NICE guidelines on Sacral nerve stimulation for faecal incontinence. Tibial nerve stimulation is a fairly new treatment for bowel incontinence. A fine needle is inserted into the tibial nerve just above the ankle and an electrode is placed on the foot. A mild electric current is passed through the needle to stimulate the tibial nerve. It's not known exactly how this treatment works, but it's thought to work in a similar way to sacral nerve stimulation. NICE concludes that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works. See the NICE guidelines on Treating faecal incontinence by stimulating the tibial nerve. Bulking agents, such as collagen or silicone, can be injected into the muscles of the sphincter and rectum to strengthen them. The use of bulking agents in this way is a fairly new technique, so there's little information about their long-term effectiveness and safety. You should discuss the possible advantages and disadvantages of this type of treatment in full with your treatment team before deciding whether to proceed. See the NICE guidelines on Treating faecal incontinence with injectable bulking agents. Endoscopic radiofrequency (heat) therapy is a fairly new treatment for bowel incontinence. Heat energy is applied to the sphincter muscles through a thin probe, to encourage scarring of the tissue. This helps tighten the muscles and helps to control bowel movements. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recently produced guidelines on this procedure. NICE concluded that the procedure appears to be safe, although there are still uncertainties about how well it works. As well as the uncertainties surrounding this procedure, it is also expensive. Therefore, it is usually only used on the NHS during clinical trials. See the NICE guidelines on Treating faecal incontinence using endoscopic radiofrequency therapy. An artificial sphincter may be implanted if you have bowel incontinence caused by a problem with your sphincter muscles. This operation involves placing a circular cuff under the skin around the anus. The cuff is filled with fluid and sits tightly around the anus, keeping it closed. A tube is placed under the skin from the cuff to a control pump. In men, the pump is placed near the testicles, in women its placed near the vagina. A special balloon is placed into the tummy, and this is connected to the control pump by tubing that runs under the skin. The pump is activated by pressing a button located under the skin. This drains the fluid from the cuff into the balloon, so your anus opens and you can pass stools. When you are finished, the fluid slowly refills the cuff and the anus closes. The use of an artificial sphincter is a relatively new procedure, so there isn't much good-quality information about its long-term effectiveness and safety. Possible problems include infection, injury during surgery and the cuff becoming dislodged. In some cases, further surgery is required to correct problems. See the NICE guidelines on Treating faecal incontinence with an artificial sphincter inserted through a cut in the abdomen. A colostomy is usually only recommended if other surgical treatments are unsuccessful. A colostomy is a surgical procedure in which your colon (lower bowel) is cut and brought through the wall of your stomach to create an artificial opening. Your stools can then be collected in a bag, known as a colostomy bag, which is attached to the opening."

catarrh,"Catarrh is a build-up of mucus in an airway or cavity of the body. It usually affects the back of the nose, the throat or the sinuses (air-filled cavities in the bones of the face). It's often temporary, but some people experience it for months or years. This is known as chronic catarrh. Catarrh can be a nuisance and may be difficult to get rid of, but it's not harmful and there are treatments available. Catarrh can lead to a: These problems can be frustrating to live with and may affect your sleep, making you feel tired. Catarrh will often pass in a few days or weeks as the condition that causes it improves. There are things you can try at home to relieve your symptoms, such as: There are also several remedies, such as herbal medicines, available from health shops and pharmacies that claim to treat catarrh. Some people find these helpful, but there's generally little scientific evidence to suggest they work. Speak to your GP if your catarrh persists and is becoming difficult to live with. They may want to rule out conditions that could be causing it, such as nasal polyps or allergies. This may mean you need to be referred to a specialist for tests. If you're diagnosed with a specific underlying condition, treating it may help relieve your catarrh. For example, nasal polyps may be treated with a steroid nasal spray, or in some cases surgery. If a cause for you catarrh cannot be found, the self-help techniques above may be recommended. Unfortunately, however, chronic catarrh can be hard to treat and may last for a long time. Catarrh is usually caused by the immune system reacting to an infection or irritation, which causes the lining of your nose and throat to become swollen and produce mucus. This can be triggered by: It's unclear what causes chronic catarrh, but it's not thought to be the result of an allergy or infection. It may be related to an abnormality in the way mucus travels within the nose or an increased sensitivity to mucus in the back of the nose and throat."

cold-sore,"Cold sores are small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth. They're caused by the herpes simplex virus and usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days. You may not have any symptoms when you first become infected with the herpes simplex virus. An outbreak of cold sores may happen some time later. Cold sores often start with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Small fluid-filled sores then appear, usually on the edges of your lower lip. Read more about the symptoms of cold sores. If you have cold sores you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory. Cold sores aren't usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required. If you've had outbreaks of cold sores before, it's likely that you'll know what they are if they return. You only need to visit your pharmacist if you're unsure whether it's a cold sore or if it's severe and spreading further than just the lip. See your pharmacist if a cold sore hasn't healed after 7 to 10 days. The strain of herpes simplex virus usually responsible for cold sores is known as HSV-1. In rare cases, cold sores can also be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). This can be the result of having oral sex with someone who has genital herpes. Read more about the causes of cold sores. The herpes simplex virus or ""cold sore virus"" is highly contagious and can be easily passed from person to person by close direct contact. After someone has contracted the virus, it remains inactive (dormant) most of the time. However, every so often the virus can be activated by certain triggers, resulting in an outbreak of cold sores. These triggers vary from person to person, but can include sunlight, fatigue, an injury to the affected area, and, in women, their period. Some people have frequently recurring cold sores around two or three times a year, while others have one cold sore and never have another. Some people never get cold sores at all because the virus never becomes active. Cold sores usually clear up by themselves without treatment within 7 to 10 days. However, antiviral creams are available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription. If used correctly, these can help ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time. To be effective, these treatments should be applied as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear when you feel a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Using an antiviral cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much of an effect. Cold sore patches are also available that contain hydrocolloid gel, which is an effective treatment for skin wounds. The patch is placed over the cold sore while it heals. Antiviral tablets may be prescribed for severe cases. Read more about treating cold sores. Cold sores are usually mild, but may cause complications in rare cases. People with weak immune systems caused by illness or treatments such as chemotherapy are particularly at risk of complications. Dehydration sometimes occurs if drinking fluids becomes painful. Young children are particularly at risk of becoming dehydrated. The herpes simplex virus can also spread to other parts of your body. Examples of when this can occur include: Left untreated, herpetic keratoconjunctivitis can cause the cornea, the transparent layer at the front of your eye, to become infected, which can eventually lead to blindness. It's therefore important not to touch your eyes if you have an unhealed cold sore. If you must touch your eyes for example, to remove contact lenses wash your hands thoroughly first. In very rare cases, encephalitis, a condition where the brain becomes inflamed and swollen, can be caused by the cold sore virus spreading to the brain. It can be treated with intravenous injections of antiviral medications, such as aciclovir. It's not possible to prevent infection with the herpes simplex virus or prevent outbreaks of cold sores, but you can take steps to minimise the spread of infection. Cold sores are at their most contagious when they burst (rupture), but remain contagious until they're completely healed. Avoid close contact with others until your cold sore has completely healed and disappeared. However, there's no need to stay away from work or miss school if you or your child have a cold sore. You can help minimise the risk of the cold sore virus spreading and cold sores recurring by following the advice below: You won't usually have any symptoms when you first become infected with the herpes simplex virus (the primary infection). An outbreak of cold sores may occur some time later and keep coming back (recurrent infection). However, if the primary infection does cause symptoms, they can be quite severe. Symptoms of the primary infection are most likely to develop in children younger than five years old. Symptoms include: Herpes simplex gingivostomatitis usually affects young children, but adults can also develop it. It can last 7 to 14 days, with the sores taking up to three weeks to heal. However, gingivostomatitis doesn't usually recur after the primary infection. Primary herpes simplex viruses are rare in adults, but the symptoms are similar to those experienced by children. You'll usually have a sore throat with or without swollen glands. You may also have bad breath (halitosis) and painful sores in and around your mouth. These can develop into ulcers with grey or yellow centres. If you develop the herpes simplex virus at an early age, it may be triggered periodically in later life and can cause recurring bouts of cold sores. After the primary infection, the symptoms are usually reduced to just the cold sores themselves. Recurrent infections usually last for less time and are less severe than the primary infection. The only symptom is an outbreak of cold sores, although you may also have swollen glands. An outbreak of cold sores usually starts with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Small fluid-filled sores then develop, usually on the edges of your lower lip. If you have frequent recurrent infections, you may develop cold sores in the same place every time. They may grow in size and cause irritation and pain. Initially, they may ooze before crusting or scabbing over within 48 hours of the initial tingling sensation. If the cold sores are very troublesome, it's possible to suppress them by taking an antiviral tablet called acyclovir regularly, every day for a few months. This is usually only recommended if cold sores are causing a lot of problems, and they may come back when treatment is stopped. Most cold sores disappear within 7 to 10 days without treatment and usually heal without scarring. Cold sores are usually caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). In most cases the virus is passed on in early childhood for example, when a child is kissed by a family member or friend with a cold sore. The virus passes through the skin and travels up the nerves, where it lies inactive (dormant) until it's triggered at a later date. Factors thought to trigger outbreaks of cold sores include: However, in many cases there's no obvious trigger for an outbreak. Occasionally, cold sores can be caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). This can happen after having oral sex with a man or woman who has genital herpes, which is usually caused by HSV-2. In genital herpes, painful blisters develop on your genitals and the surrounding area. Cold sores usually clear up without treatment within 7 to 10 days. Antiviral tablets or cream can be used to ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time. If you develop a cold sore, some general advice to follow includes: Antiviral creams such as aciclovir or penciclovir (also known as Fenistil) may speed up the healing time of a recurrent cold sore infection if used correctly. Cold sore creams are widely available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription. They're only effective if you apply them as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear, when the herpes simplex virus is spreading and replicating. Using an antiviral cream after this initial period is unlikely to have much effect. If you have frequently recurring bouts of cold sores, use antiviral medication as soon as you feel the tingling sensation that indicates a cold sore is about to develop. You'll need to apply the cream up to five times a day for four to five days. Antiviral creams can only help to heal a current outbreak of cold sores. They don't get rid of the herpes simplex virus or prevent future outbreaks of cold sores occurring. Antiviral tablets are generally more effective than creams at treating cold sores, but are usually only prescribed for more severe cases. Cold sore patches that contain a special gel called hydrocolloid are also available. They're an effective treatment for skin wounds and are placed over the cold sore to hide the sore area while it heals. Several non-antiviral creams are also available over the counter from pharmacies without the need for a prescription. These creams aren't specifically designed to treat cold sores and won't help them heal faster, but they may help ease any pain or irritation. Ask your pharmacist to recommend a suitable treatment for you. Pain can also be treated with painkillers such as ibuprofen or paracetamol both are available in liquid form for young children. However, don't take ibuprofen if you have asthma or stomach ulcers, or you've had them in the past. Children under the age of 16 shouldn't be given aspirin. Speak to your pharmacist if you have cold sores and you're pregnant. If your cold sores are particularly severe or your immune system is damaged for example, if you have HIV or you're having chemotherapy treatment you may be at risk of developing serious complications. For example, your risk of developing encephalitis or the infection spreading to other parts of your body, such as your eyes, is increased. Speak to your GP if you're at risk. They may prescribe antiviral tablets and refer you for specialist treatment. The type of treatment recommended will depend on the severity of your cold sore symptoms and the complication that's causing problems. For example, if you develop herpetic keratoconjunctivitis a secondary eye infection you may need to see an ophthalmologist, a specialist eye doctor. Visit your pharmacist if you or your child develops swollen, painful gums (gingivostomatitis) as a result of the primary herpes simplex infection. They'll be able to suggest treatments to help ease your symptoms. If the infection is painful, your pharmacist may suggest using a preparation that contains benzydamine, which is available as an oral rinse or oral spray, to help relieve any pain in your mouth or throat. Brushing your teeth may also be painful because of the swelling of your gums. Your pharmacist may suggest using an antiseptic mouthwash. This helps prevent secondary infections and will also control a build-up of plaque if you can't brush your teeth effectively. As with the treatment of cold sores, any pain or fever can be treated using ibuprofen or paracetamol. In rare cases of gingivostomatitis, it's possible for your lips to become stuck together in places. Using a lip barrier cream available from your local pharmacist will help prevent this. If you or your child has gingivostomatitis, it's important to drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated. Young children are particularly at risk as they may refuse to eat or drink because of the pain in their mouth. It's important to watch out for signs of dehydration, such as: Most cases of gingivostomatitis get better in 7 to 14 days, although it may take up to three weeks for the sores to heal completely. If you or your child still has symptoms of gingivostomatitis after two weeks or the infection is severe your pharmacist may advise you to contact your GP, who may refer you for specialist treatment. Specialist referral may also be needed for gingivostomatitis if you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system. Visit your GP if you have a newborn baby who develops gingivostomatitis, as they may also need to be referred for specialist treatment."
constipation,"Constipation is a common condition that affects people of all ages. It can mean that you're not passing stools regularly or you're unable to completely empty your bowel. Constipation can also cause your stools to be hard and lumpy, as well as unusually large or small. The severity of constipation varies from person to person. Many people only experience constipation for a short time, but for others, constipation can be a long-term (chronic) condition that causes significant pain and discomfort and affects quality of life. Read more about the symptoms of constipation. It's often difficult to identify the exact cause of constipation. However, there are a number of things that contribute to the condition, including: In children, poor diet, fear about using the toilet and problems toilet training can all lead to constipation. Read more about the causes of constipation. Constipation can occur in babies, children and adults. It's estimated that around 1 in every 7 adults and up to 1 in every 3 children in the UK has constipation at any one time. The condition affects twice as many women as men and is also more common in older adults and during pregnancy. If you have constipation you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory. Constipation isn't usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you contact your GP practice if required. Also speak to your pharmacist if you think your child might be constipated. Laxatives are often recommended for children alongside diet and lifestyle changes. You may be able to treat constipation yourself by making simple changes to your diet and lifestyle (see below). If these changes don't help and the problem continues, you should see your pharmacist. However, you should see your GP for advice if: Diet and lifestyle changes are usually recommended as the first treatment for constipation. This includes gradually increasing your daily intake of fibre, making sure you drink plenty of fluids, and trying to get more exercise. If these aren't effective, your pharmacist may recommend an oral laxative medication that can help you empty your bowels. Treatment for constipation is effective, although in some cases it can take several months before a regular bowel pattern is re-established. Read more about treating constipation. Making the diet and lifestyle changes mentioned above can also help to reduce your risk of developing constipation in the first place. Giving yourself enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably may also help, and you should try not to ignore the urge to go to the toilet. Read more about preventing constipation. For most people constipation rarely causes complications, but people with long-term constipation can develop: Read more about the complications of constipation. When you're constipated, passing stools becomes more difficult and less frequent than usual. Normal bowel habits vary from person to person. Some adults go to the toilet more than once a day, whereas others may only go every 3 or 4 days. Similarly, some infants pass stools several times a day, while others only pass them a few times a week. If you or your child pass stools less than usual, it could be a sign of constipation. It may also be more difficult to pass stools and you may feel unable to empty your bowel completely. Your stools may appear dry, hard and lumpy, as well as abnormally large or small. Other symptoms of constipation can include: As well as infrequent or irregular bowel movements, a child with constipation may also have any of the following symptoms: Constipation usually occurs when stools remain in the colon (large intestine) for too long, and the colon absorbs too much water from the stools, causing them to become hard and dry. Most cases of constipation aren't caused by a specific condition and it may be difficult to identify the exact cause. However, several factors can increase your chances of having constipation, including: Constipation may sometimes be a side effect of a medicine you're taking. Common types of medication that can cause constipation include: If constipation is caused by medication, the condition will usually ease once you stop taking the medicine. However, you shouldn't stop taking any prescribed medication unless your GP advises you to. Speak to your pharmacist if you have constipation that's caused by a medicine. They may be able to advise you on how to treat the problem, or they might recommend you see your GP for an alternative medicine if appropriate. About 2 in every 5 women experience constipation during their pregnancy, mostly during the early stages. Constipation occurs during pregnancy because your body produces more of the female hormone progesterone, which acts as a muscle relaxant. The bowel normally moves stools and waste products to the anus by a process known as peristalsis. This is when the muscles lining the bowel contract and relax in a rippling, wave-like motion. An increase in progesterone makes it more difficult for the bowel muscles to contract, making it harder to move waste products along. If you're pregnant, there are ways to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. Read more about treating constipation. In rare cases, constipation can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as: Constipation in babies and children is quite common. It's estimated that up to 1 in every 3 children in the UK has constipation at any time. Poor diet, fear about using the toilet and poor toilet training can all be responsible. Children who are over-fed are more likely to have constipation, as are those who don't get enough fluids. Babies who have too much milk are also more likely to get constipation. As with adults, it's very important that your child has enough fibre in their diet. It's important that you don't make your child feel stressed or pressured about using the toilet. It's also important to let your children try things by themselves (when appropriate). Constantly intervening when they're using the toilet may make them feel anxious and may contribute to constipation. Some children can feel stressed or anxious about using the toilet. They may have a phobia about using the toilet, or feel they are unable to use the toilets at school. This fear may be the result of your child experiencing pain when passing stools. This can lead to poor bowel habits, where children ignore the urge to pass stools and instead withhold them for fear of experiencing pain and discomfort. However, if they do this, their condition will only get worse. In rare cases, constipation in babies and children can be a sign of an underlying condition, such as: Constipation is a very common condition. Your pharmacist won't usually need to carry out any tests or procedures, but will confirm a diagnosis based on your symptoms and medical history. Your pharmacist will ask you some questions about your bowel habits. Don't feel embarrassed about discussing this with your pharmacist. It's important they're aware of all of your symptoms, so they can make the correct diagnosis. Your pharmacist may also ask questions about your diet, level of exercise and whether there have been any recent changes to your routines. Constipation can be defined in a number of ways: If your pharmacist thinks you may have faecal impaction (when dry, hard stools collect in your rectum), they may advise you to contact your GP for a physical examination. See complications of constipation for more information about faecal impaction. A typical examination will begin with you lying on your back, while the GP feels your abdomen (tummy). You'll then lie on your side while your GP carries out a rectal examination using a lubricated, gloved finger. Your GP will be able to feel for any stools that may have collected. An internal physical examination rarely needs to be carried out on a child. Instead, the diagnosis can usually be made by feeling the child's tummy. If you're experiencing severe symptoms, your doctor may request further tests, such as blood tests or thyroid tests, to diagnose or rule out other conditions. Other tests you may have include: As there's an increased risk of bowel cancer in older adults, your doctor may also request tests to rule out a diagnosis of cancer, including a computerised tomography (CT) scan or colonoscopy. Treatment for constipation depends on the cause, how long you've had it and how severe your symptoms are. In many cases, it's possible to relieve the symptoms by making dietary and lifestyle changes. The various treatments for constipation are outlined below. Changes to diet and lifestyle are often recommended as the first treatment for constipation. In many cases, this will improve the condition without the need for medication. Some self-help methods of treating constipation are listed below: Read about preventing constipation for more ways to change your diet and lifestyle. Your pharmacist may recommend an oral laxative if diet and lifestyle changes don't help. Laxatives are a type of medicine that help you pass stools. There are several different types of laxative and each one has a different effect on your digestive system. Your pharmacist will usually start you on a bulk-forming laxative. These work by helping your stools to retain fluid. This means they're less likely to dry out, which can lead to faecal impaction. Bulk-forming laxatives also make your stools softer, which means they should be easier to pass. Commonly prescribed bulk-forming laxatives include ispaghula husk, methylcellulose and sterculia. When taking this type of laxative, you must drink plenty of fluids, and don't take them before going to bed. It will usually be 2 to 3 days before you feel the effects of a bulk-forming laxative. If your stools remain hard after you've taken a bulk-forming laxative, your pharmacist may prescribe an osmotic laxative instead. Osmotic laxatives increase the amount of fluid in your bowels. This softens your stools and stimulates your body to pass them. Commonly prescribed osmotic laxatives include lactulose and macrogols. As with bulk-forming laxatives, make sure you drink enough fluids. It will usually be 2 to 3 days before you feel the effect of the laxative. If your stools are soft, but you still have difficulty passing them, your pharmacist may recommend a stimulant laxative. This type of laxative stimulates the muscles that line your digestive tract, helping them to move stools and waste products along your large intestine to your anus. The most commonly prescribed stimulant laxatives are senna, bisacodyl and sodium picosulphate. These laxatives are usually only used on a short-term basis, and they start to work within 6 to 12 hours. According to your individual preference and how quickly you need relief, your pharmacist may decide to combine different laxatives. If you've had constipation for a short time, your pharmacist will usually advise you to stop taking the laxative once your stools are soft and easily passed. However, if your constipation is caused by an underlying medical condition or a medicine you're taking, your GP may advise you to take laxatives for much longer, possibly many months or even years. If you've been taking laxatives for some time, you may have to gradually reduce your dose, rather than coming off them straight away. If you have been prescribed a combination of laxatives, you'll normally have to reduce the dosage of each laxative, one at a time, before you can stop taking them. This can take several months. Your GP will advise you about when it's best to stop taking long-term laxatives. Faecal impaction occurs when stools become hard and dry and collect in your rectum. This obstructs the rectum, making it more difficult for stools to pass along. Sometimes as a result of impaction, overflow diarrhoea may occur (where loose stools leak around the obstruction). You may have difficulty controlling this. If you have faecal impaction, you'll initially be treated with a high dose of the osmotic laxative macrogol. After a few days of using macrogol, you may also have to start taking a stimulant laxative. If you don't respond to these laxatives, and/or if you have overflow diarrhoea, you may need one of the medications described below. If you're pregnant, there are ways for you to safely treat constipation without harming you or your baby. Your pharmacist will first advise you to change your diet by increasing fibre and fluid intake. You'll also be advised to do gentle exercise. If dietary and lifestyle changes don't work, you may be prescribed a laxative to help you pass stools more regularly. Lots of laxatives are safe for pregnant women to use because most aren't absorbed by the digestive system. This means that your baby won't feel the effects of the laxative. Laxatives that are safe to use during pregnancy include the osmotic laxatives lactulose and macrogols. If these don't work, your pharmacist may recommend taking a small dose of bisacodyl or senna (stimulant laxatives). However, senna may not be suitable if you're in your third trimester of pregnancy, because it's partially absorbed by your digestive system. Read more about constipation and other common pregnancy problems. If your baby is constipated but hasn't started to eat solid foods, the first way to treat them is to give them extra water between their normal feeds. If you're using formula milk, make the formula as directed by the manufacturer and don't dilute the mixture. You may want to try gently moving your baby's legs in a bicycling motion or carefully massaging their tummy to help stimulate their bowels. If your baby is eating solid foods, give them plenty of water or diluted fruit juice. Try to encourage them to eat fruit, which can be pured or chopped, depending on their ability to chew. The best fruits for babies to eat to treat constipation are: Never force your baby to eat food if they don't want to. If you do, it can turn mealtimes into a battle and your child may start to think of eating as a negative and stressful experience. If your baby is still constipated after a change in diet, they may have to be prescribed a laxative. Bulk-forming laxatives aren't suitable for babies, so they'll usually be given an osmotic laxative. However, if this doesn't work, they can be prescribed a stimulant laxative. For children, laxatives are often recommended alongside changes to diet. Osmotic laxatives are usually tried first, followed by a stimulant laxative if necessary. As well as eating fruit, older children should have a healthy, balanced diet, which also contains vegetables and wholegrain foods, such as wholemeal bread and pasta. Try to minimise stress or conflict associated with meal times or using the toilet. It's important to be positive and encouraging when it comes to establishing a toilet routine. Allow your child at least 10 minutes on the toilet, to make sure they've passed as many stools as possible. To encourage a positive toilet routine, try making a diary of your child's bowel movements linked to a reward system. This can help them focus on using the toilet successfully. Constipation rarely causes any complications or long-term health problems. Treatment is usually effective, particularly if it's started promptly. However, if you have long-term (chronic) constipation, you may be more at risk of experiencing complications. Continually straining to pass stools can cause pain, discomfort and rectal bleeding. In some cases, bleeding is the result of a small tear around the anus (anal fissure), but it's more often caused by haemorrhoids (piles). Piles are swollen blood vessels that form in the lower rectum and anus. As well as bleeding, piles can also cause pain, itching around the anus, and swelling of the anus. The symptoms of piles often settle down after a few days without treatment. However, creams and ointments are available to reduce any itching or discomfort. See your pharmacist as soon as possible if you experience any rectal bleeding. Long-term constipation can increase the risk of faecal impaction, which is where dried, hard stools collect in your rectum and anus. Once you have faecal impaction, it's very unlikely that you'll be able to get rid of the stools naturally. Faecal impaction makes constipation worse because it's harder for stools and waste products to pass out of your anus, as the path is obstructed. Faecal impaction can sometimes lead to a number of other complications, including: Faecal impaction is usually treated with laxative medication, although suppositories (medication inserted into the anus) and mini enemas (where medicine in fluid form is injected through your anus) may sometimes be used. There are a number of things you can do to prevent constipation, including making diet and lifestyle changes. Including enough fibre in your diet can significantly reduce your chances of developing constipation. Most adults don't eat enough fibre. You should aim to have about 30g of fibre a day. You can increase your fibre intake by eating more: Eating more fibre will keep your bowel movements regular, because it helps food pass through your digestive system more easily. Foods high in fibre also make you feel fuller for longer. It's important to increase your fibre intake gradually, because a sudden increase may make you feel bloated. Suddenly increasing your intake of fibre may also cause you to produce more wind (flatulence) and experience stomach cramps. Read more about how to increase your intake of fibre and eating a healthy, balanced diet. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration, and steadily increase your intake when exercising or when it's hot. Try to cut back on the amount of caffeine, alcohol and fizzy drinks you consume. Never ignore the urge to go to the toilet, because it can significantly increase your chances of having constipation. When going to the toilet, make sure you have enough time and privacy to pass stools comfortably. Keeping active and mobile will greatly reduce your risk of getting constipation. You should do at least 150 minutes of physical activity every week. As well as regular exercise reducing your risk of becoming constipated, it will also leave you feeling healthier and improve your mood, energy levels and general fitness.

living-well-with-copd,"Living with COPD can be difficult but it doesn't have to mean your working life or social life are over. Simple techniques to manage COPD can help you cope better with your condition. These include: Living with COPD will be challenging at times but you can make small changes to your daily routine and mindset which will have a big impact on your quality of life. Read more hints and tips on how to live well with COPD. Many people find having a long term condition or 'invisible condition' isolating, and the changes in their situation can lead them to withdraw from work and social life. This can have a serious impact on your mental wellbeing. Joining your local COPD support group is a good way to meet people who really understand what you are going through. They can help give you advice on how to live well with COPD and support you through difficult times. Many groups also offer outings, social occasions and hobby classes such as singing or walking. To find your nearest COPD support group use our Service Directory. Many people find pulmonary rehabilitation very useful to learn about helpful techniques to manage COPD. Ask your health care professional about pulmonary rehabilitation, it can teach you useful methods such as pursed lip breathing to help with shortness of breath. Common myths about COPD that can stop people from getting the right treatment. Although smoking is the main cause of COPD, not everyone who has COPD is a smoker. COPD is also caused by: You can't assume that a person with COPD smokes or dismiss the illness as 'self inflicted'. Exercising is actually recommended to individuals with COPD. Regular exercise can improve your breathing, make your symptoms less severe and improve your quality of life. Even chair-bound individuals with severe breathlessness can do some adapted exercises such as upper arm exercises. Find out more about exercising with COPD COPD primarily affects the lungs but it also can cause: COPD can also increases the risk of heart disease and like any long term condition, depression and mental illness can also come into play. COPD has no cure yet, but this doesn't mean that it's untreatable. By improving your lifestyle, you can live a long and full life with COPD. A common misinterpretation is that 'Chronic' means really bad or extreme rather than long term. Individuals who exercise more and maintain a healthy weight can experience less severe symptoms and enjoy a better quality of life. Practising breathing techniques could also increase your lung capacity. If you smoke, quitting smoking will also help to combat COPD symptoms. This is simply not true. Both men and women can have COPD. In fact in Scotland, women develop the condition with a lower exposure to smoking than men. Many individuals with COPD are over 65, however you can experience COPD symptoms at any age. It's thought COPD is only diagnosed when individuals' symptoms can no longer be ignored. They may have been experiencing these symptoms much earlier in their 40's and 50's and done nothing about it. It's also thought that two thirds of people with COPD are undiagnosed and go undiagnosed until later life. It's never to late to quit smoking, as this could slow the progression of COPD. COPD will not go away if you quit smoking, but it could benefit your health. Quitting could potentially allow some lung function to return.

Everyone will have different triggers that affect their lungs, this could be traffic pollution, dry ice, smoke from a wood burning stove, spices or many other things. The important thing is working out what makes your condition worse and taking steps to avoid or reduce contact with these things. People with COPD can have flare ups linked to seasonal changes, for example a high pollen count in the spring and summer or very cold air in the winter. Here are some tips to help you In the spring and summer the pollen level may affect your lungs. If you have had your bedroom window open during the day cover the bed with a dust sheet and carefully remove it before bed. This will catch any pollen coming through the open window during the day. If you dry your clothes outside during the summer remember this might increase the amount of pollen on them. In summer use a damp cloth over your hair when you come in from outside as this will help remove the pollen stuck to you. Take your coat and shoes off before entering your house to avoid bringing in too much pollen and carrying it through your house. In winter wear a scarf over your mouth when you go outside to stop cold air irritating your lungs. Have your flu vaccine. If you have COPD, getting flu can cause lots of problems and trigger a serious flare-up of your condition. Read further information on managing flare ups. Many people start to panic when they feel breathless. To prevent a panic attack one thing you can do is find out more about your condition. If you understand what is happening to your body it takes away the panic from not knowing what is happening to you. If you do have a panic attack the following tips could help: There are various breathing techniques that some people find helpful for panic attacks or breathlessness. These include breathing control, which involves breathing gently, using the least effort, with the shoulders supported. Breathing techniques for people who are more active include: You can make living with COPD easier by making small changes to your home, you might find some of these suggestions helpful: Many people find having a long term condition link COPD very isolating. There are many benefits to joining a local support group for COPD: Some people with COPD find using a dehumidifier in the home improves their symptoms. These are available from many online retailers. Others find that wearing a mask on airplanes or when walking in the city can help to reduce the impact of 'recycled' air traffic pollution on the lungs. Using a walker or trolley can provide extra support when walking and means that you don't have to carry shopping on your arms, so the weight is spread more evenly. Many walkers/trolleys also have a seat option so you can rest if you need to. Having a chronic illness such as COPD can put a strain on any relationship. Difficulty breathing and coughing can make people with COPD feel very tired and depressed. It is also inevitable that their spouse, partner or carer will feel anxious or frustrated about their breathing problems. It is important to talk about your worries together. Being open about how you feel and what your family and friends can do to help may put them at ease. But do not feel shy about telling them that you need some time to yourself, if that is what you want. As COPD progresses, the increasing breathlessness can make it difficult to take part in activities. The breathlessness may occur during sexual activity, which may mean your sex life can suffer. Communicate with your partner and stay open-minded. Explore what you both like sexually. Simply touching, being touched and being close to someone helps a person feel loved and special. Your doctor, nurse or physiotherapist may also be able to suggest ways to help manage breathlessness during sex. If you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are planning to fly, go to your GP for a fitness-to-fly assessment. This involves checking your breathing using spirometry and measuring your oxygen levels. Before travelling, remember to pack all your medication, such as inhalers, in your hand luggage. If you are using oxygen therapy, tell your travel operator and airline before you book your holiday, as you may need to get a medical form from your GP. If you are using long-term oxygen therapy, arrange to take an adequate oxygen supply with you abroad. For further information, read the British Lung Foundation information about going on holiday with a lung condition. People with COPD often have to give up work because their breathlessness stops them from doing what they need to do for their job. This can cause financial pressure. There are several benefits for which people with COPD may be eligible: Read further information: COPD is a serious condition. At least 25,000 people die each year from the end stages of COPD. As with other conditions that cannot be reversed or cured, it is important to receive good care at the end of life. Talking about this and planning it in advance can be helpful. This is called palliative care. It can be difficult to talk about dying with your doctor and, particularly with family and friends, but many people find that it helps. Support is also available for your family and friends. It may be helpful to discuss which symptoms you may have as you become more seriously ill, and the treatments that are available to reduce these. As COPD progresses, your doctor should work with you to establish a clear management plan based on your and your carer's wishes. This will include whether you would prefer to go to hospital, a hospice or be looked after at home as you become more ill. You may want to discuss drawing up an advance decision, also called a living will, which sets out your wishes for treatment if you become too ill to be consulted. This might include whether you want to be resuscitated if you stop breathing, and whether you want artificial ventilation to be continued. Read further information: Studies have shown that if you exercise with COPD and keep regularly active it can improve breathing and reduce some of your symptoms. Many people find joining a walking or singing group helpful for increasing their lung capacity. Others find physiotherapy, Tai chi or yoga can really help their fitness and breathing. When you have COPD you may become less active to avoid getting breathless. This results in loss of fitness and confidence, which in turn increases your breathlessness. Breathlessness itself isn't dangerous, it's a normal response to exertion. Having COPD means this response can happen more quickly and is simply the lungs working harder to get more oxygen into your body. You should exercise as much as you can, however limited that may be, twice a day. Even chair-bound people can do some arm and upper-body movements. You can improve your fitness and mobility by trying some simple exercises in the home. Remember to ask a health care professional for approval before attempting any exercise. You can use light weights to do this movement or even household items such as tins of food. Other simple stretches that you can perform from your seat or in your home include: Tai chi was originally created as a form of martial art, today it is practised as a health-promoting, low-impact activity. Tai chi is a particularly popular activity for individuals with COPD because it helps to ease muscles and relax you. Many of the movements and poses involved can also be adapted for people with restricted movement including oxygen therapy users. Find out more about tai chi Not all physical activity has to be high intensity. If you have difficulty standing or are afraid of falling, chair dancing is a great way to stay active and have fun. Chair dancing is simple and has several benefits such as: Chair dancing is great as a group activity as it gives you a chance to socialise and reminisce with friends to your favourite songs. If you are on oxygen treatment, some exercises may not be suitable for you as the oxygen tank may be inconvenient. However you can still do some exercises whilst on oxygen. Remember to ask a health care professional for approval before attempting any exercise. You may find it helpful to use longer tubing on your oxygen tank for more freedom to move around when exercising. If you experience any of the following symptoms you should stop exercising immediately: Read further information: Carrying extra weight can make breathlessness worse. Therefore, it is a good idea to lose weight if you are overweight. This can be difficult because the breathlessness caused by COPD can make it hard to exercise. However, some people with COPD find that they lose weight. Eating food high in protein and taking in enough calories is important to maintain a healthy weight. Research has shown that people with COPD who are underweight will have fewer COPD symptoms if they increase their weight.

dehydration,"Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take in. When the normal water content of your body is reduced, it upsets the balance of minerals (salts and sugar) in your body, which affects the way it functions. Water makes up over two-thirds of the healthy human body. It lubricates the joints and eyes, aids digestion, flushes out waste and toxins, and keeps the skin healthy. Some of the early warning signs of dehydration include: A baby may be dehydrated if they: The body is affected even when you lose a small amount of fluid. Read more about the symptoms of dehydration Dehydration is usually caused by not drinking enough fluid to replace what we lose. The climate, the amount of physical exercise you are doing (particularly in hot weather) and your diet can contribute to dehydration. You can also become dehydrated as a result of an illness, such as persistent vomiting and diarrhoea, or sweating from a fever. Read more about the causes of dehydration Anyone can become dehydrated, but certain groups are particularly at risk. These include: If you're dehydrated, drink plenty of fluids such as water, diluted squash or fruit juice. These are much more effective than large amounts of tea or coffee. Fizzy drinks may contain more sugar than you need and may be harder to take in large amounts. If you're finding it difficult to keep water down because you're vomiting, try drinking small amounts more frequently. Infants and small children who are dehydrated shouldn't be given large amounts of water alone as the main replacement fluid. This is because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body too much and lead to other problems. Instead, they should be given diluted squash or a rehydration solution (available from pharmacies). You might find a teaspoon or syringe can be helpful for getting fluid into a young child. If left untreated, severe dehydration can be serious and cause fits (seizures), brain damage and death. Read more about treating dehydration See your GP if your symptoms continue, despite drinking plenty of fluids, or if you think your baby or toddler is dehydrated. If your GP suspects dehydration, you may have a blood test or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body. Contact your GP, out-of-hours service or NHS 24 111 service straight away if you have any of the following symptoms: You should also contact your GP if your baby has had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours. Dehydration can be mild, moderate or severe, depending on how much of your body weight is lost through fluids. Two early signs of dehydration are thirst and dark-coloured urine. This is the body's way of trying to increase water intake and decrease water loss. Other symptoms may include: Dehydration can also lead to a loss of strength and stamina. It's a main cause of heat exhaustion. You should be able to reverse dehydration at this stage by drinking more fluids. If dehydration is ongoing (chronic), it can affect your kidney function and increase the risk of kidney stones. It can also lead to muscle damage and constipation. See your GP if your symptoms continue despite drinking fluids, or if you suspect that your baby or toddler is dehydrated. You should also contact your GP if your baby has had six or more episodes of diarrhoea in the past 24 hours, or if they have vomited three times or more in the past 24 hours. If dehydration is suspected, you may be given a blood test or a urine test to check the balance of salts (sodium and potassium) in your body. If dehydration is left untreated, it can become severe. Severe dehydration is a medical emergency and requires immediate medical attention. Contact your GP, out-of-hours service or NHS 24 111 service straight away if you have any of the following symptoms: If severe dehydration is not treated immediately, it can lead to complications. This level of dehydration needs hospital treatment and you will be put on a drip to restore the substantial loss of fluids. A baby may be dehydrated if they have: Read about how to treat dehydration in babies Dehydration is caused by not drinking enough fluid or by losing more fluid than you take in. Fluid is lost through sweat, tears, vomiting, urine or diarrhoea. The severity of dehydration can depend on a number of factors, such as climate, level of physical activity and diet. There are several causes of dehydration, which are described below. Dehydration is often the result of an illness, such as gastroenteritis, where fluid is lost through persistent bouts of diarrhoea and vomiting. You can also become dehydrated if you sweat excessively after a fever, exercise, or carrying out heavy, manual work in hot conditions. In these situations, it's important to drink regularly to replace lost fluids. It doesn't necessarily need to be hot for you to lose a significant amount of fluid from sweating. Children and teenagers are particularly at risk because they may ignore the symptoms of dehydration, or not know how to recognise and treat them. Dehydration can also occur as a result of drinking too much alcohol. Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it makes you wee more. The headache associated with a hangover indicates that your body is dehydrated. You should try to drink plenty of water when you have been drinking alcohol. If you have diabetes, you're at risk of becoming dehydrated because you have high levels of glucose in your bloodstream. Your kidneys will try to get rid of the glucose by creating more urine, so your body becomes dehydrated from going to the toilet more frequently. Read more about the different types of diabetes The groups of people most at risk of dehydration are: It's possible to become overhydrated while exercising. This is known as hyponatremia and it's caused by low sodium (salt) levels in the blood. It can occur if too much water is drunk over a short period of time. Hyponatremia sometimes affects athletes whose blood sodium level is reduced through sweat and then diluted by drinking large amounts of water. Symptoms of hyponatremia include nausea, vomiting and headache. In serious cases, the brain can swell, causing confusion, seizures, coma and, in rare cases, death. The best way to treat dehydration is to rehydrate the body by drinking plenty of fluids, such as water, diluted squash or diluted fruit juice. A sweet drink can help to replace lost sugar, and a salty snack can help to replace lost salt. If your baby is dehydrated, take them to see your GP as soon as possible. They'll be able to recommend appropriate treatments, such as those outlined below. Give your baby plenty of liquids, such as breastmilk or formula. It can often be better to give them smaller amounts of fluid more frequently. Don't dilute your baby's formula (if you use it). Babies who are formula-fed and those on solids can be given extra water. Avoid giving your baby fruit juice, particularly if they have diarrhoea and vomiting, because it can make it worse. Giving your baby regular sips (a few times an hour) of oral rehydration solution (ORS) in addition to their usual feed (breastmilk, formula milk and water) will help to replace lost fluids, salts and sugars. Infants and children who are dehydrated shouldn't be given solely water, because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body and make the problem worse. Instead, they should have diluted squash or a special ORS (see below). If you or your child is finding it difficult to hold down fluids because of vomiting, take smaller amounts more frequently. You may find it easier to use a spoon or a syringe to give your child small amounts of fluid. Read more about vomiting in adults and vomiting in children and babies When you're dehydrated, you lose sugar and salts, as well as water. Drinking a rehydration solution will enable you to re-establish the right balance of body fluids. The solution should contain a mixture of potassium and sodium salts, as well as glucose or starch. There are several different rehydration products available over the counter from pharmacies or on prescription from your GP, including solutions that are suitable for infants and children. Ask your GP or pharmacist for advice about the most suitable rehydration solution for you or your child. Seek immediate medical help if you suspect someone is severely dehydrated (see symptoms of severe dehydration). They may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment. In particular, babies, infants and elderly people will need urgent treatment if they become dehydrated. Fluid may be given up the nose using a nasogastric tube or using a saline drip into a vein (intravenously). This will provide essential nutrients faster than using solutions that you drink. If you have had bowel surgery, some rehydration solutions may not contain enough salt. In this instance, you will need a higher-strength solution. Your GP or surgeon can recommend a suitable rehydration solution for you. You should drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated. Most of the time, you can prevent dehydration by drinking water regularly throughout the day. Be guided by your thirst, but be aware that in hot weather, when exercising and during illness, you should drink more. Mild dehydration can be relieved by drinking more water and diluted fruit squash. If necessary, you can purchase oral rehydration solutions (ORS) from a pharmacy. As a guide, passing pale or clear-coloured urine (wee) is a good sign that you're well hydrated. If you're active, or if the weather is particularly hot, there's a greater risk that you will become dehydrated. To prevent becoming dehydrated, you should increase your fluid intake. As different people sweat at different rates, it's very difficult to provide specific recommendations about how much fluid you should drink. However, you should drink more than normal while exercising, and it's particularly important to keep well hydrated if you're exercising in warm conditions. This is because you will sweat more and fluid will be lost from your body more rapidly. Rarely, drinking more fluid than your body can process can reduce the amount of sodium (salt) in your blood. This can lead to a serious and potentially fatal condition called hyponatremia. If you start to feel discomfort and bloating from drinking, stop drinking and allow time to recover. If you, your child or someone you are caring for is ill, particularly with a fever, vomiting or diarrhoea, there's a high risk of becoming dehydrated, so it's important to start replacing fluid as soon as possible. There are no specific recommendations regarding the amount of water or other fluids that children need. However, it's important for children to replace lost fluid, to prevent dehydration. Like adults, children lose more water when they are in hotter climates and when they are physically active. You should give your child healthy drinks as part of an overall healthy, balanced diet."

dry-mouth,"It's normal to occasionally have a dry mouth if youre dehydrated or feeling nervous, but a persistently dry mouth can be a sign of an underlying problem. You should see your dentist or GP if you have an unusually dry mouth (known as xerostomia) so they can try to determine the cause. A dry mouth can occur when the salivary glands in your mouth don't produce enough saliva. This is often the result of dehydration, which means you dont have enough fluid in your body to produce the saliva you need. It's also common for your mouth to become dry if you're feeling anxious or nervous. A dry mouth can sometimes be caused by an underlying problem or medical condition, such as: If you see your dentist or GP, let them know about any other symptoms you're experiencing and any treatments youre having, as this will help them work out why your mouth is dry. Saliva plays an important role in keeping your mouth healthy. If you have a dry mouth, you may experience a number of other problems too, such as: Its important to maintain good oral hygiene if you have a dry mouth to reduce the risk of dental problems. You should also see a dentist regularly, so they can identify and treat any problems early on. If your doctor or dentist is able to determine what's causing your dry mouth, treating this may improve your symptoms. For example, if medication is suspected as the cause of your dry mouth, your doctor may reduce your dose or suggest trying an alternative medication. Some of the conditions mentioned above have specific treatments, such as nasal decongestants for a blocked nose and insulin for diabetes. There are simple measures you can try to help keep your mouth moist. For example, it may help to: If the measures above dont help, your dentist, GP or specialist may suggest using an artificial saliva substitute to keep your mouth moist. This may come in the form of a spray, gel or lozenge. Use it as often as you need to, including before and during meals. If your dry mouth is caused by radiotherapy or Sjgren's syndrome, a medication called pilocarpine may be prescribed. This is taken as a tablet several times a day to help stimulate your salivary glands to produce more saliva. However, pilocarpine isn't suitable for everyone, as it may cause side effects, such as sweating or headaches."

flatulence,"Flatulence is passing gas from the digestive system out of the back passage. It's more commonly known as ""passing wind"", or ""farting"". Farting is often laughed about, but excessive flatulence can be embarrassing and make you feel uncomfortable around others. However, it can usually be controlled with changes to your diet and lifestyle. Flatulence is a normal biological process and is something everyone experiences regularly. Some people pass wind only a few times a day, others a lot more, but the average is said to be about 5 to 15 times a day. When you swallow food, water or saliva, you also swallow small amounts of air, which collects in the digestive system. Gases can also build up when you digest food. The body needs to get rid of the build-up by farting (flatulence) or burping (belching). Sometimes you may not notice you have passed wind because most of the gases are odourless and often released in small quantities. Flatulence usually only has a bad smell if it contains gases that smell, such as sulphur. However, it's important to remember it's normal for the gas you pass to sometimes smell a bit. Excessive flatulence can be caused by swallowing more air than usual or eating food that's difficult to digest. It can also be related to an underlying health problem affecting the digestive system, such as recurring indigestion or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Read more about the causes of flatulence. There are no medical guidelines defining the normal frequency or volume of flatulence. You're probably the best person to assess your own symptoms. See your GP if your flatulence is particularly troublesome for example, if you're frequently passing smelly gas. You should also visit your GP if you experience additional symptoms, such as: These symptoms could be an indicator of a more serious health problem and may require investigation, such as a blood or stool test to look for an infection. Excessive flatulence can usually be controlled by making changes to your diet and lifestyle, such as: There are also some over-the-counter medications that can help if your flatulence is troublesome, such as charcoal tablets or simethicone. If your flatulence is related to an underlying health problem, treating the condition may help resolve it. Read more about treating flatulence. There are several natural causes of flatulence. Flatulence can also be caused by some health conditions related to the digestive system, or as a side effect of certain medicines. It's perfectly normal to swallow air while breathing and eating. However, it's easy to swallow a lot more air than usual without realising it. This can cause excessive flatulence. Excess air can be swallowed by: Hot and fizzy drinks also increase the amount of carbon dioxide in your stomach, although this is more likely to cause belching rather than flatulence. Some carbohydrates in food can't be digested and absorbed by the intestines. These pass down into your colon to be broken down by bacteria, producing gas, which is released as flatulence. Foods containing a high amount of unabsorbable carbohydrates include: Foods containing a lot of unrefined cereal fibre, such as bran, can also sometimes cause problems with wind and bloating. Other foods and drinks that contain a sweetener called sorbitol (such as sugar-free gum or slimming products) or a type of sugar called fructose (such as fruit juice) can also cause flatulence. This means chewing sugar-free gum can cause flatulence from both the sweetener and swallowing air. Certain foods, such as cabbage or onions, can lead to the production of gases containing sulphur, which can result in foul-smelling wind. However, the production of smelly wind can vary from person to person depending on what you eat, so it's up to you to work out which foods cause the most smell. Certain health conditions can cause symptoms of flatulence, including: Flatulence, often caused by indigestion, is a possible side effect of many types of medicine, including: Excessive flatulence can usually be treated by making changes to your diet and lifestyle. Several over-the-counter treatments are also available if your flatulence is becoming a problem. You should try to avoid eating foods high in unabsorbable carbohydrates. For a list of these foods, see causes of flatulence. Certain processed foods should also be avoided as they can contain ingredients that cause flatulence, including: However, it's still important to eat a healthy balanced diet, including at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day. Choose foods containing carbohydrates that are easy to digest. These include: It's important to note that people react differently to certain foods, so some foods listed above may still cause flatulence. You may find it useful to keep a food diary to see whether certain foods make your symptoms better or worse. You may also find it useful to eat 6 small meals a day rather than 3 large ones. Smaller meals are easier to digest and may produce less gas. There's some evidence to suggest drinking peppermint tea can help improve the symptoms of flatulence. There's also some evidence that small amounts of ginger can help with digestion or an upset stomach, which may be causing flatulence. However, pregnant women should consult their doctor before taking ginger. When eating, make sure you chew food slowly to reduce the amount of air you swallow. This will also help with digestion. Avoid chewing gum as it can also cause you to swallow more air than usual. You should also give up smoking, if you smoke. Smoking can cause you to swallow more air than usual, and tobacco smoke can irritate your digestive system. See stop smoking for more information and advice about quitting smoking. Getting plenty of exercise can help improve the functioning of your digestive system and bowel. It has also been shown to help with bloating and the passage of gas. There are several over-the-counter remedies that can help treat the symptoms of flatulence, some of which are described below. Charcoal tablets are a type of medication available over the counter from pharmacists. The charcoal absorbs gas in the digestive system, which helps reduce symptoms. Charcoal tablets may not be suitable for you if you are currently taking other medication. This is because the charcoal might absorb the medication and make it less effective. If you are taking other medication, ask your GP or pharmacist for advice before taking charcoal tablets. Clothing containing activated charcoal, or charcoal pads placed inside clothing, can help absorb foul-smelling gas released during flatulence. These products can be purchased online. Simethicone is another over-the-counter medication that can also sometimes help with gas problems. Alpha-galactosidase is a dietary supplement that may help improve the digestion of carbohydrates and reduce symptoms of flatulence. It's found in a product called Beano, which has been shown to have some effect in reducing flatulence and is available from some pharmacists and health food shops. Probiotics may also be useful in treating flatulence. Probiotics are a dietary supplement, usually sold in liquid or capsule form, which encourages the growth of ""friendly bacteria"" in your digestive system. The ""friendly bacteria"" should help digestion and reduce the symptoms of flatulence, particularly in people with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Probiotic yoghurts may also help, but avoid those with artificial sweeteners or added fibre."
flu,"Flu (influenza) is a common infectious viral illness spread by coughs and sneezes. It can be very unpleasant, but you'll usually begin to feel better within about a week. You can catch flu all year round, but it's especially common in winter, which is why it's also known as seasonal flu. Flu isn't the same as the common cold. Flu is caused by a different group of viruses and the symptoms tend to start more suddenly, be more severe and last longer. Some of the main symptoms of flu include: Cold-like symptoms, such as a blocked or runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat, can also be caused by flu, but they tend to be less severe than the other symptoms you have. Flu can make you feel so exhausted and unwell that you have to stay in bed and rest until you feel better. Read more about the symptoms of flu If you have a flu-like illness, complete our self-help guide to assess your symptoms and find out what to do next. If you're otherwise fit and healthy, there's usually no need to see your GP if you have flu-like symptoms. The best remedy is to rest at home, keep warm and drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration. You can take paracetamol or ibuprofen to lower a high temperature and relieve aches if necessary. Stay off work or school until you're feeling better. For most people, this will take about a week. Read more about treating flu at home Consider visiting your GP if: In these situations, you may need medication to treat or prevent complications of flu. Your GP may recommend taking antiviral medicine to reduce your symptoms and help you recover more quickly. Read more about antiviral medication for flu If you have flu, you generally start to feel ill within a few days of being infected. You should begin to feel much better within a week or so, although you may feel tired for much longer. You'll usually be most infectious from the day your symptoms start and for a further 3 to 7 days. Children and people with weaker immune systems may remain infectious for longer. Most people will make a full recovery and won't experience any further problems, but elderly people and people with certain long-term medical conditions are more likely to have a bad case of flu or develop a serious complication, such as a chest infection. Read more about the complications of flu The flu virus is contained in the millions of tiny droplets that come out of the nose and mouth when someone who is infected coughs or sneezes. These droplets typically spread about one metre. They hang suspended in the air for a while before landing on surfaces, where the virus can survive for up to 24 hours. Anyone who breathes in the droplets can catch flu. You can also catch the virus by touching the surfaces that the droplets have landed on if you pick up the virus on your hands and then touch your nose or mouth. Everyday items at home and in public places can easily become contaminated with the flu virus, including food, door handles, remote controls, handrails, telephone handsets and computer keyboards. Therefore, it's important to wash your hands frequently. You can catch flu many times because flu viruses change regularly and your body won't have a natural resistance to the new versions. You can help stop yourself catching flu or spreading it to others with good hygiene measures. Always wash your hands regularly with soap and warm water, as well as: You can also help stop the spread of flu by avoiding unnecessary contact with other people while you're infectious. You should stay off work or school until you're feeling better. In some people at risk of more serious flu, an annual flu vaccine or antiviral medication may be recommended to help reduce the risk of becoming infected. Read more about how to stop the spread of flu The symptoms of flu usually develop within 1 to 3 days of becoming infected. Most people will feel better within a week. However, you may have a lingering cough and still feel very tired for a further couple of weeks. Flu can give you any of the following symptoms: It can sometimes be difficult to tell if you have flu or just a cold, as the symptoms can be quite similar. The main differences are: Flu symptoms: Cold symptoms: If you are otherwise fit and healthy, there's usually no need to visit your GP if you have flu-like symptoms. You should just rest at home until you feel better, while keeping warm, drinking plenty of water and taking painkillers if necessary. Read more about how to treat flu Consider visiting your GP if: In these situations, you may need extra treatment to prevent or treat complications of flu. Usually, you can manage flu symptoms yourself at home and there's no need to see a GP. Most people feel better within a week. You should consider seeing your GP if you're at a higher risk of becoming more seriously ill. This includes people who: In these cases, your GP may suggest taking antiviral medication. If you're otherwise healthy, you can look after yourself at home by resting, keeping warm and drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration. If you feel unwell and have a fever, you can take paracetamol or anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen to lower your temperature and relieve aches. Children under 16 shouldn't be given aspirin. Stay off work or school until you're feeling better. For most people, this will take about a week. See your GP if your symptoms get worse or last longer than a week. Read the page on preventing flu for more information about stopping the infection spreading to others. In 2009, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended that doctors should consider treating people in the at-risk groups mentioned above with the antiviral medications oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) to reduce the risk of complications of flu. Antivirals work by stopping the flu virus from multiplying in the body. They won't cure flu, but they may help slightly reduce the length of the illness and relieve some of the symptoms. Recent research has suggested that Tamiflu and Relenza may not be effective at reducing the risk of flu complications and could cause side effects, so not all doctors agree they should be used. But there is evidence that antivirals can reduce the risk of death in patients hospitalised with flu. In the light of this evidence, Public Health England says it is important that doctors treating severely unwell patients continue to prescribe these drugs where appropriate. For more information read the NICE guidelines on antivirals to treat influenza. Antibiotics aren't prescribed for flu as they have no effect on viruses, although they may be prescribed if you develop a complication of flu, such as a bacterial chest infection. Complications of flu mostly affect people in high-risk groups, such as the elderly, pregnant women and those who have a long-term medical condition or weakened immune system. This is why it's important for people in these groups to have the annual flu vaccination and consider seeing their GP if they develop symptoms of flu. The most common complication of flu is a bacterial chest infection, such as bronchitis. Occasionally, this can become serious and develop into pneumonia. A course of antibiotics usually cures a chest infection or pneumonia, but it can very occasionally become life-threatening, particularly in the frail and elderly. In some people with long-term health conditions, getting flu can make their condition worse. For example, people with lung conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may find that their symptoms become more severe when they get the flu. In people with diabetes, flu can affect blood sugar levels, potentially causing hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar) or, in people with type 1 diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis (a dangerous condition caused by a lack of insulin in the body). If you have type 1 diabetes or have type 2 diabetes and take insulin, it's a good idea to monitor your blood sugar level more closely while youre feeling unwell. If you get flu while you're pregnant, there's a risk that the infection could cause problems with your pregnancy. Flu may cause you to go into premature labour (before 37 weeks of pregnancy), or it may result in your baby having a low birth weight. Occasionally, getting flu during pregnancy can result in a miscarriage or stillbirth. Less common complications of flu include: There are 3 main ways of preventing flu: The annual flu vaccine can help reduce your risk of getting flu each year, although it's not 100% effective because it doesn't work against every possible type of flu virus. With coronavirus (COVID-19) around, it is more important than ever to get the flu vaccine this autumn to protect yourself, others and the NHS. Find out more about the flu vaccine To reduce your risk of getting flu or spreading it to other people, you should always: Taking the antiviral medicines oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza) to prevent flu is recommended if all of the following apply: If there's an outbreak of flu in a residential or nursing home where the flu virus can often spread very quickly antiviral medication may be offered to people if they've been in contact with someone with confirmed flu. For more information, read the guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on antivirals to prevent influenza."

hearing-loss,"Hearing loss is a common problem that often develops with age or is caused by repeated exposure to loud noises. Action on Hearing Loss estimates that there are more than 10 million (about 1 in 6) people in the UK with some degree of hearing impairment or deafness. Hearing loss can occur suddenly, but usually develops gradually. General signs of hearing loss can include: Read more about the symptoms of hearing loss See your GP if you're having problems with your hearing, or your child is showing signs of hearing difficulty. If you lose your hearing suddenly, in one or both ears, you must see your GP as soon as possible. Your GP can check for any problems and may refer you to an audiologist (hearing specialist) or an ENT surgeon for further tests. You can also visit the Action on Hearing Loss website for an online hearing test. Read more about diagnosing hearing loss Hearing loss is the result of sound signals not reaching the brain. There are two main types of hearing loss, depending on where the problem lies: It's also possible to have both these types of hearing loss. This is known as mixed hearing loss. Some people are born with hearing loss, but most cases develop as you get older. Read more about causes of hearing loss It isn't always possible to prevent hearing loss if you have an underlying condition that causes you to lose your hearing. However, there are several things you can do to reduce the risk of hearing loss from long-term exposure to loud noise. This includes not having music or the television on at a loud volume at home and using ear protection at loud music events or in noisy work environments. You should also see your GP if you have signs of an ear infection, such as flu-like symptoms, severe earache, discharge or hearing loss. Read more about preventing hearing loss The way hearing loss is treated depends on the cause and how severe it is. In cases of sensorineural hearing loss, there are several options that may help to improve a persons ability to hear and communicate. These include: Conductive hearing loss is sometimes temporary and can be treated with medication or minor surgery, if necessary. However, more major surgery may be required to fix the ear drum or hearing bones. If conventional hearing aids don't work, there are also some implantable devices for this type of hearing loss, such as a Bone Anchored Hearing Aids (BAHAs). Read more about treating hearing loss Hearing loss is sometimes sudden, but often it's gradual and you may not notice it at first. Being aware of the early signs can help you identify the problem quickly. It's important to spot hearing loss as soon as possible, because treatment is often more beneficial if started early. Early signs of hearing loss can include: In some cases, you may recognise signs of hearing loss in someone else before they notice it themselves. Research suggests it takes 10 years from the time someone notices they have hearing loss, before they do anything about it. If you also hear a ringing, buzzing or whistling sound in your ears, this could be a sign of tinnitus, which is often associated with hearing loss. Read more about losing your hearing Babies are routinely screened within the first few weeks of their birth as part of the Newborn Hearing Screening Programme (NHSP). However, there are signs you can look out for which may suggest you should see your GP to arrange another hearing test. You should consider seeing your GP if you notice that your baby or toddler: You should consider seeing your GP if you notice that your child: Make an appointment to see your GP if you're having problems with your hearing, or your child is showing signs of hearing difficulties. If you wake up with a sudden loss of hearing in one ear or lose the hearing in one ear within a couple of days, you should see your GP as soon as possible. Read more about diagnosing hearing loss Hearing loss is the result of sound signals not reaching the brain. There are two main types of hearing loss, depending on where the problem lies. These causes are explained below. Age is the biggest single cause of hearing loss. Hearing loss that develops as a result of getting older is often known as age-related hearing loss or presbycusis. Most people begin to lose a small amount of their hearing from around 40 years of age. This hearing loss increases as you get older. By the age of 80, most people have significant hearing problems. As your hearing starts to deteriorate, high-frequency sounds, such as female or childrens voices, may become difficult to hear. It may also be harder to hear consonants such as ""s"", ""f"" and ""th"". This can make understanding speech in background noise very difficult. Another common cause of hearing loss is damage to the ear from repeated exposure to loud noises over time. This is known as noise-induced hearing loss, and it occurs when the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea become damaged. You're at higher risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss if you: Hearing loss can also occur suddenly after exposure to an exceptionally loud noise, such as an explosion. This is known as acoustic trauma. See preventing hearing loss for advice on reducing your risk of noise-induced hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss occurs if the sensitive hair cells inside the cochlea are damaged, or as a result of damage to the auditory nerve (which transmits sound to the brain). In some cases, both may be damaged. Hearing loss caused by age and exposure to loud noises are both types of sensorineural hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss can also be caused by: Some treatments and medicines, such as radiotherapy for nasal and sinus cancer, certain chemotherapy medicines or certain antibiotics can also damage the cochlea and the auditory nerve, causing sensorineural hearing loss. People with diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease are also at increased risk of hearing loss. Sensorineural hearing loss is permanent and hearing aids are often required to improve hearing in these cases. Conductive hearing loss is usually caused by a blockage, such as having too much ear wax, a build-up of fluid in the ear (glue ear), or an ear infection. Conductive hearing loss can also be caused by: Conductive hearing loss is usually temporary and can often be treated with medication or minor surgery. Read more about treating hearing loss See your GP if you're having problems with your hearing. They'll examine your ears and carry out some simple hearing tests. You may also want to visit the Action on Hearing Loss website for an online hearing test. During an ear examination, an instrument with a light at the end called an auriscope (or otoscope) is used to look for anything abnormal, including: Your GP will ask if you have any pain in your ear and when you first noticed the hearing loss. Your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist or an audiologist (a hearing specialist). The specialist will carry out further hearing tests to help determine what's causing your hearing loss and recommend the best course of treatment. Some of the hearing tests you may have include a: These tests are described below. A tuning fork is a Y-shaped, metallic object. It produces sound waves at a fixed pitch when it's gently tapped and can be used to test different aspects of your hearing. The tester taps the tuning fork on their elbow or knee to make it vibrate, before holding it at different places around your head. This test can help determine if you have conductive hearing loss, which is hearing loss caused by sounds not being able to pass freely into the inner ear, or sensorineural hearing loss, where the inner ear or hearing nerve isn't working properly. Pure tone audiometry tests the hearing of both ears. During the test, a machine called an audiometer produces sounds at various volumes and frequencies (pitches). You listen to the sounds through headphones and respond when you hear them, usually by pressing a button. A bone conduction test is often carried out as part of a routine pure tone audiometry test in adults. It's used to check if you have sensorineural hearing loss, by testing how well your inner ear is working. Bone conduction involves placing a vibrating probe against the mastoid bone behind the ear. It tests how well sounds transmitted through the bone are heard. Bone conduction is a more sophisticated version of the tuning fork test, and when used together with pure tone audiometry, it can help to determine whether hearing loss comes from the outer and middle ear (conductive hearing loss), the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss), or both. Read about how hearing tests are performed All newborn babies are offered a hearing test in the first few weeks after birth as part of the NHS Newborn Hearing Screening Programme. The tests helps to identify babies who have permanent hearing loss as soon as possible so that parents can get the support and advice they need. Read more about the newborn hearing test Very few people with hearing loss hear nothing at all. There are four different levels of hearing loss, which are defined by the quietest sound you're able to hear, measured in decibels (dB). These are described below. If you're mildly deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is 21 to 40dB. Mild deafness can sometimes make hearing speech difficult, particularly in noisy situations. If you're moderately deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is 41 to 70dB. You may have difficulty following speech without using a hearing aid and may find it difficult to hear announcements, for example. If you're severely deaf, the quietest sound you're able to hear is 71 to 90dB. People who are severely deaf usually need to lip-read or use sign language, even with the use of a hearing aid. If you're profoundly deaf, the quietest sound you can hear is more than 90dB. People who are profoundly deaf can benefit from a cochlear implant. Other forms of communication include lip reading and British sign language or signed English. Read more about treating hearing impairment, including different types of hearing aids and sign language. How hearing loss is treated depends on the underlying cause of the condition. Hearing loss that occurs when sounds are unable to pass into the inner ear (conductive hearing loss) is often temporary and treatable. For example, earwax build-up can be removed by drops, a syringe or suction. Hearing loss caused by a bacterial infection can be treated with antibiotics. Surgery can be used to drain a fluid build-up, repair a perforated eardrum, or correct problems with the hearing bones. However, hearing loss caused by damage to the inner ear or to the nerves that transmit sound to brain (sensorineural hearing loss) is permanent. If your hearing is impaired, treatment can improve your hearing and quality of life. Some of these treatments are discussed below. If you have hearing problems, you may be able to wear a hearing aid. About 1.4 million people regularly use hearing aids in the UK, and many more would benefit from them. A hearing aid is an electronic device that consists of a microphone, an amplifier, a loudspeaker and a battery. It increases the volume of sound entering your ear, so you can hear things more clearly. The microphone picks up sound, which is made louder by the amplifier. Hearing aids are fitted with devices that can distinguish between background noise, such as traffic, and foreground noise, such as conversation. Modern hearing aids are very small and discreet, and can often be worn inside your ear. Hearing aids help improve hearing, but don't give you your hearing back. They're suitable for most people, but may be less effective for people with profound hearing impairment or certain conditions. Your GP or audiologist (hearing specialist) can advise you about whether a hearing aid is suitable for you. If a hearing aid is recommended, an audiologist may take an impression of your ear so the hearing aid fits you perfectly or may show you an open fit hearing aid. The hearing aid will be adjusted to suit your level of hearing impairment. You'll also be shown how to use and care for it. After your hearing aid has been fitted, you should have a follow-up appointment within 12 weeks. If you experience problems using a hearing aid such as distortion and repeated infections that can't be corrected by an audiologist, you may benefit from different treatments. An ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeon can discuss these with you. An ENT surgeon with a special interest in ear surgery is called an otologist. The NHS loans hearing aids to people with hearing loss free of charge. This includes free repairs, batteries and servicing. Many areas now charge for lost hearing aids, but you'll be told about any costs at your fitting appointment. In the UK, both analogue and digital hearing aids are commonly used. Most hearing aids prescribed through the NHS are now digital. Instead of having moving parts, digital hearing aids contain a very small computer that processes sounds. This enables the hearing aid to be programmed to suit different environments, such as a small, quiet room or a large, noisy workshop. The type of digital hearing aids available through the NHS are usually the behind-the-ear (BTE) type (see below). Other types of hearing aid may be issued in cases where a medical condition prevents an individual from using BTE hearing aids. You can also choose to pay privately for another type of hearing aid if it's not available on the NHS. The different types of hearing aids are described below. BTE hearing aids usually have an earmould, which sits inside your ear. The rest of the hearing aid is connected to the earmould and lies behind your ear. Some types of BTE hearing aids have two microphones that enable you to listen to sounds in the general vicinity or to focus on sounds that are coming from a specific direction. This can be particularly useful in noisy environments. Open fit hearing aids may also be available, which are suitable for those with mild to moderate hearing loss. The tube sits in the ear, instead of an earmould. Receiver in-the ear (RITE) hearing aids are similar to BTE hearing aids, but the piece worn behind the ear is connected by a wire to a receiver (loudspeaker) located within the ear canal. This means RITE hearing aids are usually less visible than BTE devices. In-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids are like an earmould. They fill the area just outside your ear canal and fill the opening of your ear canal. The working parts of the hearing aid are inside the shell. In-the-canal (ITC) hearing aids fill the outer part of the ear canal and are just visible. Completely in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids are even smaller and less visible than ITE or ITC hearing aids. However, they may not be recommended if you have severe hearing loss or frequent ear infections. Body-worn (BW) hearing aids have a small box containing the microphone. The box can be clipped to your clothes or you can put it inside a pocket. A lead connects the box to an earphone, which delivers sound to your ear. This type of hearing aid is an option for people with poor dexterity, who require a high-powered hearing aid. CROS hearing aids are recommended for people who only have hearing in one ear. They work by picking up sounds from the side that doesn't have hearing and transmitting them to the ear that's able to hear. The sound is sometimes transmitted through wires, although wireless models are available. BiCROS hearing aids work in a similar way to CROS hearing aids, but they amplify the noise entering the ear that's able to hear. They're useful for people who don't have any hearing in one ear, with some hearing loss in the other ear. Bone conduction hearing aids are recommended for people with conductive or mixed hearing loss who can't wear a more conventional type of hearing aid. Bone conduction hearing aids vibrate in response to the sounds going into the microphone. They can also sometimes help people with no hearing in one ear and normal or mild hearing loss in the other ear. The part of the hearing aid that vibrates is held against the bone behind the ear (mastoid) by a headband. The vibrations pass through the mastoid bone to the cochlea and are converted into sound in the usual way. They can be very effective, but can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods. A Bone Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) transmits sound directly to the cochlea by vibrating the mastoid bone. A minor operation is needed to fix a screw to the skull, on which the hearing aid can be clipped on and off. A BAHA is removed at night and when you swim or take a shower. Unlike a bone conduction hearing aid, it's not uncomfortable to wear and is used for patients with conductive hearing loss, or in some patients who have no hearing in one of their ears. Some people may benefit from newer types of implantable bone conduction hearing aids that are held onto the head with magnets instead of a connector through the skin. However, these are only available at some BAHA centres and may require a referral to a different BAHA centre. These are surgically implanted devices that attach to the hearing bones and make them vibrate. They're suitable for people who can't use a hearing aid, but have hearing loss at a level where a BAHA would not help. Disposable hearing aids are sometimes recommended for people who have mild to moderate hearing loss. The battery inside a disposable hearing aid usually lasts for about 12 weeks, after which time the hearing aid is thrown away and replaced. Disposable hearing aids tend to be expensive in the long term and are only available privately. Cochlear implants are small hearing devices fitted under the skin behind your ear during surgery. They have an external sound processor and internal parts, including a receiver coil, an electronics package and a long wire with electrodes on it (an electrode array). The external processor takes in sound, analyses it and then converts it to signals that are transmitted across the skin to an internal receiver-stimulator, which sends the signals along the electrode array into a part of the inner ear called the cochlea. The signal is then sent to the brain along the hearing nerve as normal. This means cochlear implants are only suitable for people whose hearing nerves are functioning normally. A cochlear implant is sometimes recommended for adults or children who have severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss in both ears, which isn't helped by hearing aids. Both ears are usually implanted for children, whereas adults are usually only able to have one implant on the NHS. Before a cochlear implant is recommended, you'll be assessed to find out whether it will help improve your hearing. During the assessment, any disabilities or communication problems you have will be taken into consideration, which may mean the usual hearing tests aren't suitable. If a cochlear implant is recommended, it will be inserted into your ear (or both ears) during an operation and switched on a few weeks later. There are currently around 11,000 people in the UK with cochlear implants and the number is increasing each year. According to the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), evidence suggests that patients with cochlear implants may be at an increased risk from pneumococcal meningitis, especially if they haven't been immunised against pneumococcal disease. In August 2002, the Department of Health included cochlear implant patients in the population groups who should be immunised against pneumococcal infection. Although the risk of contracting bacterial meningitis is low, it's slightly higher than for the general population. In some cases of severe to profound hearing loss, where there are problems with the nerve that transmits sound to the brain, an auditory brainstem implant (ABI) may be used. An ABI is an electrical device made up of: When the microphone in the sound processor picks up sound, it turns it into an electrical signal and transmits this to the brain through the receiver and electrodes. An ABI will not fully restore your hearing, but it can usually restore some degree of hearing and can make lip-reading easier. It's often used as a treatment for hearing loss associated with a condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Hearing loss can sometimes affect your speech, as well as your ability to understand other people. Many people with significant hearing loss learn to communicate in other ways instead of, or as well as, spoken English. For people who experience hearing loss after they've learnt to talk, lip-reading can be a very useful skill. Lip-reading is where you watch a persons mouth movements while they're speaking, to understand what they're saying. For people born with a hearing impairment, lip-reading is much more difficult. Those who are born with a hearing impairment often learn sign language, such as British Sign Language (BSL), which is a form of communication that uses hand movements and facial expressions to convey meaning. BSL is completely different from spoken English and has its own grammar and syntax (word order). Other types of sign language include Signed English and Paget Gorman Signed Speech. The Action on Hearing Loss website has more information on British Sign Language (BSL) and lip-reading. The ears are fragile structures that can be damaged in many ways, so it's not always possible to prevent hearing loss. The risk of your hearing being damaged by loud noises depends on how loud the noises are and how long you're exposed to them. Experts agree that continued exposure to noise at or above 85dB (similar to a lawn mower or loud traffic) can, over time, cause hearing loss. However, by following the advice below it's possible to reduce your risk of noise-induced hearing loss (hearing loss from loud noise): Read more tips to protect your hearing"
heart-palpitations,"Heart palpitations are heartbeats that can become noticeable. You may or may not develop other symptoms at the same time. For example, your heart might feel like it's pounding, fluttering or beating irregularly, often for just a few seconds or minutes. You may also feel these sensations in your throat or neck. Palpitations might feel alarming but keep in mind that in most cases they aren't a sign of any problems with your heart. However, you should always get palpitation symptoms checked out with your GP or health professional. You may sometimes feel that your heart skips a beat or there is an extra beat. This is known medically as an ectopic beat. It's very common and usually nothing to worry about. Sometimes palpitations may be a sign of a heart problem. It's important to seek immediate medical assistance or call 999 if you are experience other symptoms such as: There are a number of possible causes for heart palpitations. Some of the most common are covered below. Lifestyle triggers can include: If this is the cause of your palpitations, it's sensible to try to reduce your stress levels. Try relaxation and deep breathing exercises. Find out more about stress management If you smoke, giving up is probably the greatest single step you can take to improve your health. People in Scotland can get help to stop smoking by calling Quit Your Way Scotland free on 0800 84 84 84 (7 days, 8.00am to 10.00pm) or visiting our smoking section If this is the cause of your palpitations, it's sensible to try reducing your intake of caffeinated drinks such as tea, coffee, cola or energy drinks. Whether you've taken drugs, are thinking of taking them, or are just curious and want to know more, it's important to know the real facts about drugs. Find out more on the Know The Score website If you need help now about an alcohol related issue or you just want to chat to someone about your drinking, please contact Drinkline on 0800 7 314 314 (7 days, 8.00am to 11.00pm). More about drinking alcohol responsibly Get support on healthy eating and weight loss If you experience palpitations regularly and you also have feelings of anxiety, stress and panic, you may be experiencing panic attacks. Panic attacks can be very frightening and intense, but they are not dangerous. However, it may help if you discuss these with a health professional. More about panic attacks Less commonly, palpitations can be a side effect of some types of medicine, such as asthma inhalers or tablets for a thyroid problem. This may be particularly noticeable if you have just started taking the medication. Speak to your GP if you think medication may be responsible for your palpitations. Don't stop taking a treatment without consulting your GP first. Sometimes the hormone changes that happen during a womans period, during pregnancy or around the menopause can cause palpitations. These may only be temporary, and are often nothing to worry about. The following conditions can make the heart beat faster, stronger or more irregularly, so can be a cause of heart palpitations: All palpitations should be discussed with your GP. They might want to do a few tests and ask you some questions to rule out heart problems, especially if you have had a heart problem in the past. Some heart specific problems are covered below. It could be found that you have a heart rhythm problem, also known as arrhythmia. Your GP will be able to arrange for you to have an electrocardiogram (ECG) to assess your heart rate and rhythm. This may confirm whether there is a problem, and whether treatment is needed. However, often the ECG is entirely normal especially if you aren't having palpitations at the time. Further tests may then be needed, which can be done by your GP or by your local hospital. Atrial fibrillation is the most common heart rhythm problem, affecting approximately 1,000,000 people in the UK. It can cause episodes of a fast, irregular heart rate, which can feel like a persistent heart flutter, and you may feel dizzy, short of breath and extremely tired. Atrial fibrillation is generally not life threatening, but can be uncomfortable and often needs treating. Atrial fibrillation often requires medical assessment. Some people may need treatment to control the condition, particularly if they are at higher risk of developing a stroke. Find out more about atrial fibrillation A similar heart rhythm problem, called supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), also causes episodes of an abnormally fast heart rate, but the heart rate is normally steady and not irregular. Attacks of SVT are usually harmless and tend to settle on their own without treatment. However, if they are prolonged or you feel unwell or experience symptoms such as dizziness or shortness of breath, you should seek help from a doctor."

indigestion,"Indigestion can be pain or discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia) or burning pain behind the breastbone (heartburn). Dyspepsia and heartburn may occur together or on their own. Symptoms usually appear soon after eating or drinking. Common associated symptoms include: Indigestion is a common problem that affects many people, but in most cases it's mild and only occurs occasionally. Read more about the symptoms of indigestion. Why it happens Indigestion may be caused by stomach acid coming into contact with the sensitive, protective lining of the digestive system (mucosa). The stomach acid breaks down the lining, leading to irritation and inflammation, which can be painful. The majority of people with indigestion don't have inflammation in their digestive system. Therefore, their symptoms are thought to be caused by increased sensitivity of the mucosa (to acidity or stretching). In most cases indigestion is related to eating, although it can be triggered by other factors such as smoking, drinking, alcohol, pregnancy, stress or taking certain medications. Read more about the causes of indigestion. Treating indigestion at home Most people are able to treat indigestion with simple changes to their diet and lifestyle, or with a number of different medications, such as antacids. Read more about the treatment of indigestion. Very rarely, a serious underlying health condition is the cause of indigestion. If this is suspected, then further investigation such as an endoscopy will be required (see below). If you have symptoms of indigestion you can get treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory. Most people will not need to seek medical advice for their indigestion. However, your pharmacist may advise you see your GP if you have recurring indigestion and any of the following apply: This is because these symptoms may be a sign of an underlying health condition, such as a stomach ulcer or stomach cancer. You may need to be referred for an endoscopy to rule out any serious cause. An endoscopy is a procedure where the inside of the body is examined using an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube that has a light and camera on one end). Severe indigestion can cause long-term problems with parts of your digestive tract, such as scarring of the oesophagus or the passage from your stomach. Read more about the possible complications of severe indigestion. The main symptom of indigestion is pain or a feeling of discomfort in your upper abdomen (dyspepsia). People often experience the associated feeling of burning behind the breastbone (heartburn), but this may occur on its own. These symptoms usually come on soon after eating or drinking, although there can sometimes be a delay between eating a meal and experiencing indigestion. Heartburn is caused by acid that passes from your stomach into your gullet (oesophagus). If you have indigestion, you may also have symptoms such as: Indigestion has a number of different causes, but it's rarely due to a serious, underlying condition. It's normal for your stomach to produce acid, but sometimes this acid can irritate the lining of your stomach, the top part of your bowel (duodenum) or your gullet (oesophagus). This irritation can be painful and often causes a burning sensation. Indigestion may also be due to the lining of your digestive system being overly sensitive to acid, or the ""stretching"" caused by eating. Indigestion can also be triggered or made worse by other factors. Some of these are explained below. You may have indigestion if you take certain types of medication. Some medicines, such as nitrates (taken to widen your blood vessels) relax the oesophageal sphincter (ring of muscle between your oesophagus and your stomach), which allows acid to leak back up. Other medicines, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), can affect your digestive tract and cause indigestion. Do not take NSAIDs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, if you have stomach problems, such as a stomach ulcer, or have had this in the past. Children under 16 years of age should not take aspirin. Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless you are told to do so by your GP or another qualified healthcare professional who is responsible for your care. If you are very overweight, you are more likely to experience indigestion because of increased pressure inside your stomach (abdomen). The increased pressure, particularly after a large meal, may lead to acid reflux into the oesophagus. If you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion. Read some relaxation tips to relieve stress. A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body, such as an organ, pushes through a weakness in the surrounding muscle or tissue wall. A hiatus hernia occurs when part of your stomach pushes up into your diaphragm (the sheet of muscle under your lungs). It may partially block refluxed stomach acid clearing from your oesophagus, leading to heartburn. Helicobacter infection is very common. It may lead to stomach ulcers or, rarely, stomach cancer. In most cases, however, it does not cause any symptoms at all. Some people may get bouts of indigestion from helicobacter infection and, in these cases, getting rid of the bug with antibiotics (eradication) will help. However, many cases of indigestion are not caused by helicobacter, and in these cases eradication will not get rid of symptoms. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition and one of the main causes of recurring indigestion. It's caused by acid reflux, which occurs when the oesophageal sphincter fails to prevent stomach acid from moving back up into your oesophagus. A little bit of acid reflux is normal and rarely cause any symptoms. It becomes GORD when large amounts of reflux occur, and the sensitive lining of your oesophagus may get inflamed by repeated irritation from stomach acid. This can lead to heartburn, the sensation of regurgitation or painful swallowing. A stomach ulcer is an open sore that develops on the inside lining of your stomach (a gastric ulcer) or small intestine (a duodenal ulcer). If you have a stomach ulcer, you may have indigestion as a symptom. Stomach ulcers form when stomach acid damages the lining in your stomach or duodenum wall. In most cases, the lining is damaged as a result of an H pylori infection (see above). In rare cases, recurring bouts of indigestion can be a symptom of stomach cancer. Cancer cells in your stomach break down the protective lining, allowing acid to come into contact with your stomach wall. For most people, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and infrequent, and does not require treatment from a healthcare professional. However, if you have indigestion regularly, or if it causes you severe pain or discomfort, see your pharmacist. They will ask about your indigestion symptoms, as well as: Depending on the type of indigestion symptoms you have, your pharmacist may recommend you see your GP to investigate your condition further. This is because indigestion can sometimes be a symptom of an underlying condition or health problem, such as a Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacterial infection. Details of some of the further investigations you may have are outlined below. You may be referred to hospital to have an endoscopy. An endoscopy is a procedure used to examine the inside of your body using an endoscope a thin, flexible tube, about the width of your little finger, with a light and a camera on one end. The camera is used to relay images of the inside of your body to a TV monitor. An endoscopy is not often needed to diagnose indigestion, but your GP may suggest that you have one if: Read more about having an endoscopy. Taking certain medicines for indigestion can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during an endoscopy. Therefore, for at least two weeks before your endoscopy, you will need to stop taking proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and H2-receptor antagonists. Read more about treatments for indigestion. Your GP may also recommend changing other medications that may be causing your indigestion. However, only stop taking medication if you are advised to do so by your GP or another healthcare professional responsible for your care. If your GP thinks that your symptoms may be due to an infection with H pylori bacteria, you may need to have a test for it, such as: Antibiotics and PPIs can affect the results of a urea breath test or a stool antigen test. Therefore, these tests may need to be delayed until two weeks after you last used a PPI, and four weeks after you last used an antibiotic. If your GP thinks that your indigestion symptoms may be caused by another underlying medical condition, you may need to have some further tests to rule this out. For example, abdominal pain and discomfort can also be caused by conditions affecting the bile ducts in your liver. Your bile ducts are a series of tubes that carry bile (fluid used by the digestive system to break down fats) from the liver to the gallbladder (a pouch that holds bile) and the bowel. If your GP thinks that you may have such a condition, they may suggest you have a liver function test, which is a type of blood test used to assess how well your liver is working. You may also need to have an abdominal ultrasound. An ultrasound scan uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your body. Treatment for indigestion (dyspepsia) will vary, depending on what is causing it and how severe your symptoms are. If you have been diagnosed with an underlying health condition, you may want to read our information on: If you only have indigestion occasionally, you may not need to see your pharmacist or GP for treatment. It may be possible to ease your symptoms by making a few simple changes to your diet and lifestyle, summarised below. Being overweight puts more pressure on your stomach, making it easier for stomach acid to be pushed back up into your gullet (oesophagus). This is known as acid reflux, and is one of the most common causes of indigestion. If you are overweight or obese, it is important to lose weight safely and steadily through regular exercise and by eating a healthy, balanced diet. Read advice on losing weight. If you smoke, the chemicals you inhale in cigarette smoke may contribute to your indigestion. These chemicals can cause the ring of muscle that separates your oesophagus from your stomach to relax, causing acid reflux. Read more about quitting smoking, or speak to your GP or pharmacist. You can also call the Quit Your Way Scotland service on 0800 84 84 84 (8.00am to 10.00pm, every day). Make a note of any particular food or drink that seems to make your indigestion worse, and avoid these if possible. This may mean: If you tend to experience indigestion symptoms at night, avoid eating for three to four hours before you go to bed. Going to bed with a full stomach means there is an increased risk that acid in your stomach will be forced up into your oesophagus while you are lying down. When you go to bed, use a couple of pillows to prop your head and shoulders up or, ideally, raise the head of your bed by a few inches by putting something underneath the mattress. The slight slope that is created should help to prevent stomach acid moving up into your oesophagus while you are asleep. If you regularly experience feelings of stress or anxiety, this can contribute to symptoms of indigestion. Read some relaxation tips to relieve stress. Your pharmacist may recommend making changes to your current medication if they think it could be contributing to your indigestion. As long as it is safe to do so, you may need to stop taking certain medications, such as aspirin or ibuprofen. Where required, your pharmacist may advise you see your GP to prescribe an alternative medication that will not cause indigestion. However, never stop taking any medication without consulting your pharmacist or GP first. If you have indigestion that requires immediate relief, your pharmacist can advise you about the best way to treat this. As well as lifestyle changes and reviewing your current medication, your GP may prescribe or recommend: These are described in more detail below. Antacids are a type of medicine that can provide immediate relief for mild to moderate symptoms of indigestion. They work by neutralising the acid in your stomach (making it less acidic), so that it no longer irritates the lining of your digestive system. Antacids are available in tablet and liquid form. You can buy them over the counter from most pharmacies without a prescription. The effect of an antacid only lasts for a few hours at a time, so you may need to take more than one dose. Always follow the instructions on the packet to ensure you do not take too much. It is best to take antacids when you are expecting symptoms of indigestion, or when they start to occur, such as: This is because antacids stay in your stomach for longer at these times and have more time to work. For example, if you take an antacid at the same time as eating a meal, it can work for up to three hours. In comparison, if you take an antacid on an empty stomach, it may only work for 20 to 60 minutes. Read more about antacids, including possible interactions with other medicines and side effects. Some antacids also contain a medicine called an alginate. This helps relieve indigestion caused by acid reflux. Acid reflux occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your oesophagus and irritates its lining. Alginates form a foam barrier that floats on the surface of your stomach contents, keeping stomach acid in your stomach and away from your oesophagus. Your pharmacist may suggest that you take an antacid that contains an alginate if you experience symptoms of acid reflux or if you have GORD. Take antacids containing alginates after eating, because this helps the medicine stay in your stomach for longer. If you take alginates on an empty stomach, they will leave your stomach too quickly to be effective. If you have indigestion that is persistent or recurring, treatment with antacids and alginates may not be effective enough to control your symptoms. Your pharmacist may recommend a different type of medication, which will be prescribed at the lowest possible dose to control your symptoms. Possible medications include: These are described in more detail below. Your pharmacist may advise you to see your GP who may also test you for the Helicobacter pylori (H pylori) bacteria (see Indigestion diagnosis) and prescribe treatment for this if necessary. PPIs restrict the acid produced in your stomach. The medication is taken as tablets and if you are over 18, you can buy some types of PPIs over the counter in pharmacies, but these should only be used for short-term treatment. PPIs may enhance the effect of certain medicines. If you are prescribed a PPI, your progress will be monitored if you are also taking other medicines, such as: If your ingestion is persistent, your pharmacist might advise you to see your GP. If your GP refers you for an endoscopy (a procedure that allows a surgeon to see inside your abdomen), you will need to stop taking a PPI at least 14 days before the procedure. This is because PPIs can hide some of the problems that would otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy. PPIs can sometimes cause side effects. However, they are usually mild and reversible. These side effects may include: H2-receptor antagonists are another type of medication that your pharmacist or GP may suggest if antacids, alginates and PPIs have not been effective in controlling your indigestion. There are four H2-receptor antagonists: These medicines work by lowering the acidity level in your stomach. Your GP may prescribe any one of these four H2-receptor antagonists, although ranitidine is available from pharmacies under the Pharmacy First Scotland service. H2-receptor antagonists are usually taken in tablet form. As with PPIs, you will need to stop taking H2-receptor antagonists at least 14 days before having an endoscopy if this has been arranged through your GP. This is because they can hide some of the problems that could otherwise be spotted during the endoscopy. If your indigestion symptoms are caused by an infection with H pylori bacteria, you will need to have treatment to clear the infection from your stomach. This should help relieve your indigestion, because the H pylori bacteria will no longer be increasing the amount of acid in your stomach. H pylori infection is usually treated using triple therapy (treatment with three different medications). Your GP will prescribe a course of treatment containing: You will need to take these medicines twice a day for seven days. You must follow the dosage instructions closely to ensure that the triple therapy is effective. In up to 85% of cases, one course of triple therapy is effective in clearing an H pylori infection. However, you may need to have more than one course of treatment if it does not clear the infection the first time. In most cases, indigestion (dyspepsia) is mild and only occurs occasionally. However, severe indigestion can cause complications, some of which are outlined below. Indigestion is often caused by acid reflux, which occurs when stomach acid leaks back up into your gullet (oesophagus) and irritates its lining. If this irritation builds up over time, it can cause your oesophagus to become scarred. The scarring can eventually lead to your oesophagus becoming narrow and constricted (known as oesophageal stricture). If you have oesophageal stricture, you may have symptoms such as: Oesophageal stricture is often treated using surgery to widen your oesophagus. Like oesophageal stricture, pyloric stenosis is caused by long-term irritation of the lining of your digestive system from stomach acid. Pyloric stenosis occurs when the passage between your stomach and your small intestine (known as the pylorus) becomes scarred and narrowed. This causes vomiting and prevents any food you eat from being properly digested. In most cases, pyloric stenosis is treated using surgery to return the pylorus to its proper width. Repeated episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) can lead to changes in the cells lining your lower oesophagus. This is a condition known as Barretts oesophagus. It is estimated that 1 in 10 people with GORD will develop Barretts oesophagus. Most cases of Barretts oesophagus first develop in people aged 50-70 years old. The average age at diagnosis is 62. Barretts oesophagus does not usually cause noticeable symptoms other than those associated with GORD. The concern is that Barretts oesophagus is a pre-cancerous condition. This means that while changes in the cells are not cancerous, there is a small risk they could develop into ""full blown"" cancer in the future. This would then trigger the onset of oesophageal cancer."

itchy-bottom,"Itchy bottom (pruritus ani) is characterised by a strong urge to scratch the skin around your anus. The anus is the opening at the lower end of the digestive system, where solid waste leaves your body. As itchy bottom is a symptom rather than a condition itself. Many cases have an underlying cause, for example: In children, an itchy bottom is often caused by threadworms. But not all cases of itchy bottom have an identifiable cause. Read more about the causes of itchy bottom. An itchy bottom can be made worse by: You have an itchy bottom and: At your appointment, your GP may ask about: Your GP will usually want to examine the skin around your anus and may ask to carry out a digital rectal examination (DRE) to rule out more serious underlying conditions. You may feel awkward, but it's nothing to be embarrassed or worried about, as this is one of the most common examinations GPs carry out. If necessary, you may be referred to a specialist for further investigation and treatment. An itchy bottom is usually easy to treat at home. Some ways of easing an itchy bottom include: Your GP can prescribe creams or ointments to help relieve your symptoms while self-care measures are taking effect. Check with your GP or pharmacist about how long you should use them for. If your itchy bottom is caused by an underlying condition, such as a bacterial infection or piles, it will also need to be treated. Read more about treating an itchy bottom. Frequently scratching your bottom may damage or tear the delicate skin around your anus. This may lead to problems such as: The earlier these complications are diagnosed and treated, the quicker you'll recover. If the cause of your itchy bottom can't be identified and treated, it may last for long periods of time (known as chronic itchy bottom). The cause of itchy bottom isn't always known. However, it can sometimes be a symptom of another problem or underlying condition. An itchy bottom may be a sign that your body is trying to deal with an infection. The infection may be: An itchy bottom can sometimes be a symptom of a sexually transmitted infection (STI). If you've had unprotected sex and think you could have an STI, visit your local sexual health clinic. They can offer advice and provide testing and treatment. Gastrointestinal conditions affect your digestive tract (your mouth, throat, stomach, intestines and anus). Gastrointestinal conditions that may cause an itchy bottom include: Some skin conditions can affect any area of skin on your body, including the skin around your anus. Skin conditions that can be associated with an itchy bottom include: Systemic conditions affect your whole body and can sometimes make your bottom feel itchy. Systemic conditions include: Some types of medication, including those applied directly to your skin (topical), may make your bottom feel itchy. For example, if you use a cream to treat haemorrhoids, it may irritate the sensitive skin around your anus and make the itching worse. Some topical medicines may also cause contact dermatitis (red, itchy skin) if used for long periods. Medicines that may cause an itchy bottom or make your symptoms worse include: If a medicine you're taking is causing an itchy bottom, your bottom should itch less after you've completed the course of medication. Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless advised to do so by your GP or other qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care. Speak to your GP if you're taking a medicine on a long-term basis and it's causing an itchy bottom. They may be able to prescribe an alternative. Never stop taking a prescribed medication unless advised to do so by your GP or other qualified healthcare professional responsible for your care. Speak to your GP if you're taking a medicine on a long-term basis and it's causing an itchy bottom. They may be able to prescribe an alternative. In rare cases, itchy bottom can be a symptom of a gastrointestinal cancer, such as anal cancer or bowel cancer. Most cases of itchy bottom aren't caused by cancer, but it's important that your GP rules out all possibilities. Possible symptoms of anal cancer include: Possible symptoms of bowel cancer include: Treatment for itchy bottom usually involves following simple self-care measures for a few months. If necessary, medication may be prescribed to help ease the symptoms. If you still have an itchy bottom after 2 months, or if it returns, you may need to follow this self-care advice for longer. If you have an itchy bottom, you should keep your bottom as clean and dry as possible. The best way to do this is to use water to gently clean your anus and the surrounding skin. Clean your bottom in this way after every bowel movement and before going to bed each night. You can use soap to clean your bottom, but make sure it's mild and unperfumed so it causes less irritation to your skin. Wash all of the soap away afterwards. After washing, gently dry your bottom. Avoid rubbing the area vigorously, as this may irritate your skin. Instead, gently pat the skin dry using a soft towel. You can also dry your bottom using a hairdryer on a low heat setting. When you're away from home, you can use damp toilet paper after passing stools, before gently patting your bottom dry. If you have a tendency to sweat, or if your bottom becomes very moist, putting a cotton tissue in your underwear will help absorb the moisture around your anal area. Some foods may make your itchy bottom worse. If the urge to scratch your bottom is greater after eating certain foods, try cutting them out of your diet completely or reducing the amount you eat. Foods that may make your itchy bottom worse include: Your GP may recommend that you follow a diet that keeps your stools regular and well-formed. This means your stools won't be loose (runny), but you won't need to strain when you go to the toilet. Loose stools can irritate your anus. Straining to pass hard stools may cause haemorrhoids (piles) to develop. Piles are swellings that contain enlarged and swollen blood vessels in and around your anus. Including more fibre in your diet will make your stools softer and easier to pass. Fibre can be found in: While waiting for the above self-care measures to take effect, your GP may prescribe medication to help ease your itchy bottom. However, you shouldn't use topical treatments (those applied directly to your skin) for more than 2 weeks, because they may start to harm your skin if used for long periods. Your GP may prescribe an ointment or cream to soothe the skin around your anus. You'll usually have to apply it in the morning and at night, as well as after each bowel movement. If the skin around your anus is sore and inflamed due to itching, your GP may prescribe a mild topical corticosteroid (an ointment that contains steroids). Applying this directly to the affected area will help relieve the inflammation and ease the urge to scratch. In most cases, using a topical corticosteroid will help ease the itch. However, it can sometimes make the itching worse. Speak to your GP immediately if your itchy bottom gets worse after using topical corticosteroids. If your sleep is disturbed due to itching at night, using an antihistamine may help. Antihistamines are medicines that work by counteracting the action of histamine (a chemical released during an allergic reaction). Some antihistamines also have a sedating effect (they make you drowsy). Your GP may prescribe chlorphenamine or hydroxyzine. These should be taken at night and shouldn't be used for longer than 2 weeks, because after this time the sedating effect may no longer work. You need to be aware that sedating antihistamines can affect your ability to drive or operate machinery, and the sedating effect may be stronger if you drink alcohol. When diagnosing itchy bottom, your GP will try to determine an underlying cause. If they identify the cause, such as a bacterial infection or skin condition, it will also need to be treated for your itchy bottom to be properly managed. For example, a bacterial infection may need to be treated with antibiotics. If the underlying cause is left untreated, your itchy bottom may return. An itchy bottom in children is often caused by worms. If treatment for worms is recommended, other family members with the same symptom should also be treated. Go back to your GP if your itchy bottom doesn't improve after following self-care measures, such as keeping your bottom clean and dry, and using medication to provide relief from the itching. Your GP may then refer you to a dermatologist (a specialist in treating skin conditions) or a colorectal surgeon (who specialises in conditions that affect the large intestine and anus)."
urinary-incontinence,"Urinary incontinence is the unintentional passing of urine. It is a common problem and is thought to affect millions of people worldwide. It's not clear exactly how many people are affected, but it's estimated that between 3 and 6 million people in the UK may have some degree of urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence affects both men and women, but it tends to be more common in women overall. The symptoms of urinary incontinence depend on the type you have. There are several types of urinary incontinence, but the most common are: It is also possible to have a mixture of both stress and urge urinary incontinence. Read more about the symptoms of urinary incontinence The causes of urinary incontinence depend on the type. Stress incontinence is usually the result of the weakening or damaging of the muscles used to prevent urination, such as the pelvic floor muscles and the urethral sphincter. Urge incontinence is usually the result of overactivity of the detrusor muscle, which controls the bladder. Certain things can increase the chances of urinary incontinence developing, including: Read more about the causes of urinary incontinence Although you may feel embarrassed talking to someone about your symptoms, it's a good idea to see your GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence as this can be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage the problem. Urinary incontinence can usually be diagnosed after a consultation with your GP, who will ask about your symptoms and may carry out a pelvic examination (in women) or rectal examination (in men). Your GP may also suggest you keep a diary in which you note how much fluid you drink and how often you have to urinate. Read more about diagnosing urinary incontinence Initially, your GP may suggest some simple measures to see if they help improve your symptoms. These may include: You may also benefit from the use of incontinence products, such as absorbent pads and hand-held urinals (urine collection bottles). If you are still unable to manage your symptoms, medication may be recommended. Surgery may also be considered. The specific procedures suitable for you will depend on the type of incontinence you have. Surgical treatments for stress incontinence, such as tape or sling procedures, are used to reduce pressure on the bladder, or strengthen the muscles that control urination. Operations to treat urge incontinence include enlarging the bladder or implanting a device that stimulates the nerve that controls the detrusor muscles. Read more about non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence and surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence It is not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence, but there are some steps you can take that may help reduce the chance of it developing, such as: Read more about preventing urinary incontinence Having urinary incontinence means you pass urine unintentionally. When and how this happens varies depending on the type of urinary incontinence you have. Although you may feel embarrassed about seeking help, it's a good idea to see your GP if you have any type of urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence is a common problem and seeing your GP can be the first step towards finding a way to effectively manage the problem. Around nine in every 10 people with urinary incontinence have either stress incontinence or urge incontinence. Stress incontinence is when you leak urine when your bladder is put under extra sudden pressure, for example when you cough. It is not related to feeling stressed. Other activities that may cause urine to leak include: The amount of urine passed is usually small, but stress incontinence can sometimes cause you to pass larger amounts, particularly if your bladder is very full. Urge incontinence, or urgency incontinence, is when you feel a sudden and very intense need to pass urine and you are unable to delay going to the toilet. There is often only a few seconds between the need to urinate and the release of urine. Your need to pass urine may be triggered by a sudden change of position, or even by the sound of running water. You may also pass urine during sex, particularly when you reach orgasm. This type of incontinence often occurs as part of group of symptoms called overactive bladder syndrome (OAB), which is where the bladder muscle is more active than usual. As well as sometimes causing urge incontinence, OAB can also mean you need to pass urine very frequently and you may need to get up several times during the night to urinate. Mixed incontinence is when you have symptoms of both stress and urge incontinence. For example, you may leak urine if you cough or sneeze, and also experience very intense urges to pass urine. Overflow incontinence, also called chronic urinary retention, occurs when the bladder cannot completely empty when you pass urine. This causes the bladder to swell above its usual size. If you have overflow incontinence, you may pass small trickles of urine very often. It may also feel as though your bladder is never fully empty and you cannot empty it even when you try. Urinary incontinence that is severe and continuous is sometimes known as total incontinence. Total incontinence may cause you to constantly pass large amounts of urine, even at night. Alternatively, you may pass large amounts of urine only occasionally, and leak small amounts in between. Urinary incontinence occurs when the normal process of storing and passing urine is disrupted. This can happen for a number of reasons, and certain factors may also increase your chance of developing urinary incontinence. Some of the possible causes will lead to short-term urinary incontinence, while others may cause a long-term problem. If the cause can be treated, this may cure your incontinence. Stress incontinence occurs when the pressure inside your bladder as it fills with urine becomes greater than the strength of your urethra to stay closed (the urethra is the tube through which urine passes out of your body). Any sudden extra pressure on your bladder, such as laughing or sneezing, can then cause urine to leak out of your urethra. Your urethra may not be able to stay closed if the muscles in your pelvis (pelvic floor muscles) are weak or damaged, or your urethral sphincter (the ring of muscle that keeps the urethra closed) is damaged. These problems may be caused by: The urgent and frequent need to pass urine can be caused by a problem with the detrusor muscle in the wall of the bladder. The detrusor muscles relax to allow the bladder to fill with urine, then contract when you go to the toilet to let the urine out. Sometimes the detrusor muscle contract too often, creating an urgent need to go to the toilet. This is known as having an 'overactive bladder'. The reason your detrusor muscle contracts too often may not be clear, but possible causes include: Overflow incontinence, also called chronic urinary retention, is often caused by a blockage or obstruction to your bladder. Your bladder may fill up as usual, but as it is obstructed you will not be able to empty it completely, even when you try. At the same time, pressure from the urine that is still in your bladder builds up behind the obstruction, causing frequent leaks. Your bladder can become obstructed as a result of: Overflow incontinence may also be caused by your detrusor muscle not fully contracting, which means that your bladder does not completely empty when you go to the toilet. As a result, the bladder becomes stretched. Your detrusor muscles may not fully contract if: Total incontinence occurs when your bladder cannot store any urine at all. It can result in you either passing large amounts of urine constantly, or passing urine occasionally with frequent leaking. Total incontinence can be caused by: Some medicines can disrupt the normal process of storing and passing urine, or increase the amount of urine you produce. These include: Stopping these medications, if advised to do so by a doctor, may help resolve your incontinence. In addition to the causes mentioned above, there are some things that can increase your risk of developing urinary incontinence without directly being the cause of the problem. These are known as risk factors. Some of the main risk factors for urinary incontinence include: If you experience urinary incontinence, see your GP so they can determine the type of condition you have. Try not to be embarrassed to speak to your GP about your incontinence. Urinary incontinence is a common problem and it's likely your GP has seen many people with the condition. Your GP will ask you questions about your symptoms and medical history, including: Your GP may suggest that you keep a diary of your bladder habits for at least three days, so you can give them as much information as possible about your condition. This should include details such as: You may also need to have some tests and examinations so that your GP can confirm or rule out things that may be causing your incontinence. Some of these are explained below. Your GP may examine you to assess the health of your urinary system. If you are female, your GP will carry out a pelvic examination, which usually involves undressing from the waist down. You may be asked to cough to see if any urine leaks out. Your GP may also examine your vagina. In over half of women with stress incontinence, part of the bladder may bulge into the vagina. Your GP may place their finger inside your vagina and ask you to squeeze it with your pelvic floor muscles. These are the muscles that surround your bladder and urethra (the tube through which urine passes out of the body). Damage to your pelvic floor muscles can lead to urinary incontinence. If you are male, your GP may check whether your prostate gland is enlarged. The prostate gland is located between the penis and bladder, and surrounds the urethra. If it is enlarged, it can cause symptoms of urinary incontinence, such as a frequent need to urinate. You may also need a digital rectal examination to check the health of your prostate gland. This will involve your GP inserting their finger into your bottom. If your GP thinks your symptoms may be caused by a urinary tract infection (UTI), a sample of your urine may be tested for bacteria. A small, chemically treated stick is dipped into your urine sample. It will change colour if bacteria are present. The dipstick test can also check the blood and protein levels in your urine. If your GP thinks you may have overflow incontinence, they may suggest a test called residual urine test to see how much urine is left in your bladder after you go for a wee. This is usually done by carrying out an ultrasound scan of your bladder, although occasionally the amount of urine in your bladder may be measured after it has been drained using a catheter. This is a thin, flexible tube that is inserted into your urethra and passed through to your bladder. Some further tests may be necessary if the cause of your urinary incontinence is not clear. Your GP will usually start treating you first and may suggest these tests if treatment is not effective. A cystoscopy involves using a flexible viewing tube, known as an endoscope, to look inside your bladder and urinary system. This test can identify abnormalities that may be causing incontinence. These are a group of tests used to check the function of your bladder and urethra. This may include keeping a bladder diary for a few days (see above) and then attending an appointment at a hospital or clinic for tests such as: The treatment you receive for urinary incontinence will depend on the type of incontinence you have and the severity of your symptoms. If your incontinence is caused by an underlying condition, such as an enlarged prostate gland in men, you may receive treatment for this alongside your incontinence treatment. Conservative treatments, which do not involve medication or surgery, are tried first. These include: After this, medication or surgery may be considered. This page is about non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence. There is a separate page on surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence. The various non-surgical treatments for urinary incontinence are outlined below. Your GP may suggest you make simple changes to your lifestyle to improve your symptoms. These changes can help improve your condition, regardless of the type of urinary incontinence you have. For example, your GP may recommend: Your pelvic floor muscles are the muscles you use to control the flow of urine as you urinate. They surround the bladder and urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body). Weak or damaged pelvic floor muscles can cause urinary incontinence, so exercising these muscles is often recommended. Your GP may refer you to a specialist to start a programme of pelvic floor muscle training. Your specialist will assess whether you are able to squeeze (contract) your pelvic floor muscles and by how much. If you can contract your pelvic floor muscles, you will be given an individual exercise programme based on your assessment. Your programme should include doing a minimum of eight muscle contractions at least three times a day and doing the recommended exercises for at least three months. If the exercises are helping after this time, you can keep on doing them. Research suggests that women who complete pelvic floor muscle training experience fewer leaking episodes and report a better quality of life. In men, some studies have shown that pelvic floor muscle training can reduce urinary incontinence particularly after surgery to remove the prostate gland. For more information: If you are unable to contract your pelvic floor muscles, using a device that measures and stimulates the electrical signals in the muscles may be recommended. This is called electrical stimulation. A small probe will be inserted into the vagina in women or the anus in men. An electrical current runs through the probe, which helps to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles while you exercise them. You may find electrical stimulation difficult or unpleasant to use, but it may be beneficial if you are unable to complete pelvic floor muscle contractions without it. Biofeedback is a way to monitor how well you are doing the pelvic floor exercises by giving you feedback as you do them. There are several different methods of biofeedback: There isn't much good evidence to suggest biofeedback offers a significant benefit to people using pelvic floor muscle training for urinary incontinence, but the feedback may help motivate some people to carry out their exercises. Speak to your specialist if you would like to try biofeedback. If you have been diagnosed with urge incontinence, one of the first treatments you may be offered is bladder training. Bladder training may also be combined with pelvic floor muscle training if you have mixed urinary incontinence. Bladder training involves learning techniques to increase the length of time between feeling the need to urinate and passing urine. The course will usually last for at least six weeks. While incontinence products are not a treatment for urinary incontinence, you might find them useful for managing your condition while you are waiting to be assessed or waiting for treatment to take effect. Incontinence products include: If stress incontinence does not significantly improve, surgery for urinary incontinence will often be recommended as the next step. However, if you are unsuitable for surgery or you want to avoid having an operation, you may benefit from a medication called duloxetine. This can help increase the muscle tone of the urethra, which should help keep it closed. You will need to take duloxetine by mouth twice a day and will be assessed after two to four weeks to see if the medicine is beneficial or if it is causing any side effects. Possible side effects of duloxetine can include: Do not suddenly stop taking duloxetine as this can also cause unpleasant effects. Your GP will reduce your dose gradually. Duloxetine is not suitable for everyone, however, so your GP will discuss any other medical conditions you have to determine if you can take it. If bladder training is not an effective treatment for your urge incontinence, your GP may prescribe a type of medication called an antimuscarinic. Antimuscarinics may also be prescribed if you have overactive bladder syndrome (OAB), which is the frequent urge to urinate that can occur with or without urinary incontinence. A number of different antimuscarinic medications that can be used to treat urge incontinence, but common ones include oxybutynin, tolterodine and darifenacin. These are usually taken by mouth two or three times a day, although an oxybutynin patch that you place on your skin twice a week is also available. Your GP will usually start you at a low dose to minimise any possible side effects. The dose can then be increased until the medicine is effective. Possible side effects of antimuscarinics include: In rare cases, antimuscarinic medication can also lead to a type of glaucoma (a build-up of pressure within the eye) called angle-closure glaucoma. You will be assessed after four weeks to see how you are getting on with the medication, and every six to 12 months thereafter if the medication continues to help. Your GP will discuss any other medical conditions you have to determine which antimuscarinics are suitable for you. If antimuscarinics are unsuitable for you, or they have not helped your urge incontinence or have caused unpleasant side effects, you may be offered an alternative medication called mirabegron. Mirabegron causes the bladder muscle to relax, which helps the bladder fill up with and store urine. It is usually taken by mouth once a day. Side effects of mirabegron can include: Your GP will discuss any other medical conditions you have to determine whether mirabegron is suitable for you. A medication called desmopressin may be used to treat nocturia, which is the frequent need to get up during the night to urinate, by helping to reduce the amount of urine produced by the kidneys. Another type of medication taken late in the afternoon, called a loop diuretic, may also prevent you from getting up in the night to pass urine. Diuretic medicine increases the production and flow of urine from your body. By removing excess fluid from your body in the afternoon, it may improve symptoms at night. Desmopressin is licensed to treat bedwetting but is not licensed to treat nocturia. Loop diuretics are also not licensed to treat nocturia. This means that the medication may not have undergone clinical trials (a type of research that tests one treatment against another) to see if it's effective and safe in the treatment of nocturia. However, your GP or specialist may suggest an unlicensed medication if they think it's likely to be effective and the benefits of treatment outweigh any associated risk. If your GP is considering prescribing desmopressin or a loop diuretic, they should tell you that it is unlicensed and will discuss the possible risks and benefits with you. If other treatments for urinary incontinence are unsuccessful or unsuitable, surgery or other procedures may be recommended. Before making a decision, discuss the risks and benefits with a specialist, as well as any possible alternative treatments. If you are a woman and plan to have children, this will affect your decision, because the physical strain of pregnancy and childbirth can sometimes cause surgical treatments to fail. Therefore, you may wish to wait until you no longer want to have any more children before having surgery. The various surgical treatments for urinary incontinence are outlined below. Colposuspension involves making an incision in your lower abdomen, lifting up the neck of your bladder, and stitching it in this lifted position. This can help prevent involuntary leaks in women with stress incontinence. There are two types of colposuspension: Both types of colposuspension offer effective, long-term treatment for stress incontinence, although laparoscopic colposuspension needs to be carried out by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Problems that can occur after colposuspension include difficulty emptying the bladder fully when going to the toilet, recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) and discomfort during sex. Sling procedures involve making an incision in your lower abdomen and vagina so a sling can be placed around the neck of the bladder to support it and prevent accidental urine leaks. The sling can be made of: In many cases, an autologous sling will be used and will be made using part of the layer of tissue that covers the abdominal muscles (rectus fascia). These slings are generally preferred because more is known about their long-term safety and effectiveness. The most commonly reported problem associated with the use of slings is difficulty emptying the bladder fully when going to the toilet. A small number of women who have the procedure also find that they develop urge incontinence afterwards. An urethral bulking agent is a substance that can be injected into the walls of the urethra in women with stress incontinence. This increases the size of the urethral walls and allows the urethra to stay closed with more force. A number of different bulking agents are available and there is no evidence that one is more beneficial than another. This is less invasive than other surgical treatments for stress incontinence in women as it does not usually require any incisions. Instead, the substances are normally injected through a cystoscope (thin viewing tube) inserted directly into the urethra. However, this procedure is generally less effective than the other options available. The effectiveness of the bulking agents will also reduce with time and you may need repeated injections. Many women experience a slight burning sensation or bleeding when they pass urine for a short period after the bulking agents are injected. The urinary sphincter is a ring of muscle that stays closed to prevent urine flowing from the bladder into your urethra. In some cases, it may be suggested that you have an artificial urinary sphincter fitted to relieve your incontinence. This tends to be used more often as a treatment for men with stress incontinence and is only rarely used in women. An artificial sphincter consists of three parts: The procedure to fit an artificial urinary sphincter often causes short-term bleeding and a burning sensation when you pass urine. In the long-term, it is not uncommon for the device to eventually stop working, in which case further surgery may be needed to remove it. Botulinum toxin A (Botox) can be injected into the sides of your bladder to treat urge incontinence and overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). This medication can sometimes help relieve these problems by relaxing your bladder. This effect can last for several months and the injections can be repeated if they help. Although the symptoms of incontinence may improve after the injections, you may find it difficult to fully empty your bladder. If this happens, you will need to be taught how to insert a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) into your urethra to drain the urine from your bladder. Botulinum toxin A is not currently licensed to treat urge incontinence or OAB, so you should be made aware of any risks before deciding to have the treatment. The long-term effects of this treatment are not yet known. The sacral nerves are located at the bottom of your back. They carry signals from your brain to some of the muscles used when you go to the toilet, such as the detrusor muscle that surrounds the bladder. If your urge incontinence is the result of your detrusor muscle contracting too often, sacral nerve stimulation also known as sacral neuromodulation may be recommended. During this operation, a device is inserted near one of your sacral nerves, usually in one of your buttocks. An electrical current is sent from this device into the sacral nerve. This should improve the way signals are sent between your brain and your detrusor muscles, and so reduce your urges to urinate. Sacral nerve stimulation can be painful and uncomfortable, but some people report a substantial improvement in their symptoms or the end of their incontinence completely. Your posterior tibial nerve runs down your leg to your ankle. It contains nerve fibres that start from the same place as nerves that run to your bladder and pelvic floor. It is thought that stimulating the tibial nerve will affect these other nerves and help control bladder symptoms, such as the urge to pass urine. During the procedure, a very thin needle is inserted through the skin of your ankle and a mild electric current is sent through it, causing a tingling feeling and causing your foot to move. You may need 12 sessions of stimulation, each lasting around half an hour, one week apart. Some studies have shown that this treatment can offer relief from OAB and urge incontinence for some people, although there is not yet enough evidence to recommend tibial nerve stimulation as a routine treatment. Tibial nerve stimulation is only recommended in a few cases where urge incontinence has not improved with medication and you don't want to have botulinum toxin A injections or sacral nerve stimulation. In rare cases, a procedure known as augmentation cystoplasty may be recommended to treat urge incontinence. This procedure involves making your bladder bigger by adding a piece of tissue from your intestine (part of the digestive system) into the bladder wall. After the procedure, you may not be able to pass urine normally and you may need to use a catheter. Due to this, augmentation cystoplasty will only be considered if you are willing to use a catheter. The difficulties passing urine can also mean that people who have augmentation cystoplasty can experience recurrent urinary tract infections. Urinary diversion is a procedure where the ureters (the tubes that lead from your kidneys to your bladder) are redirected to the outside of your body. The urine is then collected directly without it flowing into your bladder. Urinary diversion should only be carried out if other treatments have been unsuccessful or are not suitable. Urinary diversion can cause a number of complications, such as a bladder infection, and sometimes further surgery is needed to correct any problems that occur. Clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC) is a technique that can be used to empty the bladder at regular intervals and so reduce overflow incontinence (also known as chronic urinary retention). A continence adviser will teach you how to place a catheter through your urethra and into the bladder. Your urine will flow out of your bladder, through the catheter and into the toilet. Using a catheter can feel a bit painful or uncomfortable at first, but any discomfort should subside over time. How often CIC will need to be carried out will depend on your individual circumstances. For example, you may only need CIC once a day, or you may need to use the technique several times a day. Regular use of a catheter increases the risk of developing UTIs. If using a catheter every now and then is not enough to treat your overflow incontinence, you can have an indwelling catheter fitted instead. This is a catheter inserted in the same way as for CIC, but left in place. A bag is attached to the end of the catheter to collect the urine. It is not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence, but a healthy lifestyle may reduce the chances of the condition developing. Being obese can increase your risk of developing urinary incontinence. You may therefore be able to lower your risk by maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise and healthy eating. Find more information and advice about losing weight Depending on your particular bladder problem, your GP can advise you about the amount of fluids that you should drink. If you have urinary incontinence, cut down on alcohol and drinks containing caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola. These can cause your kidneys to produce more urine and irritate your bladder. The recommended daily limits for alcohol consumption are: A unit of alcohol is roughly half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits. Read more about drinking and alcohol. If you have to urinate frequently during the night (nocturia), try drinking less in the hours before you go to bed. However, make sure you still drink enough fluids during the day. Being pregnant and giving birth can weaken the muscles that control the flow of urine from your bladder. If you are pregnant, strengthening your pelvic floor muscles may help prevent urinary incontinence. Read more about staying active during pregnancy. Men may also benefit from strengthening their pelvic floor muscles by doing pelvic floor exercises."

If you are not registered with any dental practice then you should read our advice on dental emergencies. Mouth ulcers are painful sores that appear in the mouth. Although they're uncomfortable, theyre usually harmless and most clear up by themselves within a week or two. Mouth ulcers are common and can usually be managed at home, without seeing your dentist or GP. Mouth ulcers are usually round or oval sores that commonly appear inside the mouth on the: They can be white, red, yellow or grey in colour and swollen. It's possible to have more than one mouth ulcer at a time and they may spread or grow. Mouth ulcers shouldn't be confused with cold sores, which are small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth. Cold sores often begin with a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. If you have a mouth ulcer you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory. Mouth ulcers can be painful, which can make it uncomfortable to eat, drink or brush your teeth. It's usually safe to treat mouth ulcers at home, although your pharmacist may advise that yousee your GP or dentist if: Mouth ulcers are also a possible symptom of a viral infection that mainly affects young children, called hand, foot and mouth disease. Speak to your GP or call the NHS 24 111service if you're unsure. Read about the symptoms of hand, foot and mouth disease. Mouth ulcers dont usually need to be treated, because they tend to clear up by themselves within a week or two. However, treatment can help to reduce swelling and ease any discomfort. This may help if you keep getting mouth ulcers or your mouth ulcer affects eating and drinking. Self care Things you can do to speed up healing include: Pharmacy medicines You can get several types of mouth ulcer treatment from a pharmacy. Speak to your pharmacist about the best treatment for you. Options include the following: Medicines from your dentist or GP If necessary, you may be prescribed a course of stronger corticosteroids to help reduce pain and swelling, and speed up healing. Corticosteroids are available on prescription as tablets, mouthwash, paste or spray, but are not suitable for children under 12. In a few cases, a long-lasting mouth ulcer can be a sign of mouth cancer. Ulcers caused by mouth cancer usually appear on or under the tongue, although you can get them in other areas of the mouth. Risk factors for mouth cancer include: It's important to detect mouth cancer as early as possible. If mouth cancer is detected early, the chances of a complete recovery are good. Regular dental check-ups are the best way to detect the early signs. In many cases, the reason for mouth ulcers is unclear. Most single mouth ulcers are caused by damage to the lining inside of the mouth. For example: Its not always clear what causes mouth ulcers that keep returning, but triggers are thought to include: Your genes are also thought to have a role around 40% of people who keep getting mouth ulcers report that it runs in their family. Medical conditions Mouth ulcers can sometimes be caused by certain medical conditions, such as: Medications and treatments Mouth ulcers can sometimes be caused by certain medications or treatments, such as: It may not be possible to prevent mouth ulcers, because they're often caused by things you can't control (such as a family history or a medical condition). However, the following may help to reduce your risk of developing mouth ulcers: Read more advice on dental health."

shortness-of-breath,"Sudden shortness of breath, or breathing difficulty (dyspnoea), is the most common reason for visiting a hospital accident and emergency department. It's also one of the most common reasons people phone 999 for an ambulance. It's normal to get out of breath when you've overexerted yourself, but when breathlessness comes on suddenly and unexpectedly, it's usually a warning sign of a medical condition. The information below outlines the most common reasons for: This guide shouldn't be used to self-diagnose your condition, but should give you an idea of what's causing your breathlessness. You should phone your GP immediately if you have sudden unexpected shortness of breath, as there may be a problem with your airways or heart. Your GP will assess you over the phone, and may either visit you at home or admit you to hospital. If your shortness of breath is mild or the result of anxiety, you may be asked to come to the surgery rather than a home visit. If you've struggled with your breathing for a while, don't ignore it. See your GP as it's likely you have a long-term condition, such as obesity, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which needs to be managed properly. Your doctor may ask you some questions, such as: Feeling like you can't get enough air can be terrifying, but doctors are well trained in managing this. You may be given extra oxygen to breathe if this is needed. Sudden and unexpected breathlessness is most likely to be caused by one of the following health conditions. Click on the references at the end for more information about these conditions. Sudden breathlessness could be an asthma attack. This means your airways have narrowed and you'll produce more phlegm (sticky mucus), which causes you to wheeze and cough. You'll feel breathless because it's difficult to move air in and out of your airways. Your GP may advise you to use a spacer device with your asthma inhaler. This delivers more medicine to your lungs, helping to relieve your breathlessness. Pneumonia (lung inflammation) may also cause shortness of breath and a cough. It's usually caused by an infection, so you'll need to take antibiotics. If you have COPD, it's likely your breathlessness is a sign this condition has suddenly got worse. It's possible to have a ""silent"" heart attack without experiencing all the obvious symptoms, such as chest pain and overwhelming anxiety. In this case, shortness of breath may be the only warning sign you're having a heart attack. If you or your GP think this is the case, they'll give you aspirin and admit you to hospital straight away. Heart failure can also cause breathing difficulties. This life-threatening condition means your heart is having trouble pumping enough blood around your body, usually because the heart muscle has become too weak or stiff to work properly. It leads to a build-up of fluid inside the lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. A combination of lifestyle changes and medicines or surgery will help the heart pump better and relieve your breathlessness. Breathlessness could also relate to a problem with your heart rate or rhythm, such as atrial fibrillation (an irregular and fast heart rate) or supraventricular tachycardia (regular and fast heart rate). A panic attack or anxiety can cause you to take rapid or deep breaths, known as hyperventilating. Concentrating on slow breathing or breathing through a paper bag can bring your breathing back to normal but should only be done when you are certain anxiety is the cause of your breathlessness. These include: Long-term breathlessness is usually caused by: More unusual causes of long-term breathlessness are:"

testicular-lumps-and-swellings,"Lumps and swellings in the testicles are a relatively common symptom in boys, men and anyone with testicles and can have a number of different causes. The vast majority of testicular lumps and swellings are caused by benign (non-cancerous) conditions that may not need treatment, but it's important to know what's normal for you and to see your GP if you notice any changes in your testicles so they can try to identify the cause. There are many possible reasons why your testicles may become swollen or develop a lump. Some of the main causes are: A sudden and severely painful swelling in one of your testicles can be a sign of a condition called testicular torsion, which is where the blood supply to a testicle is interrupted. In rare cases, testicular lumps can be a sign of testicular cancer. Cancer Research UK estimates that fewer than four in every 100 testicular lumps are cancerous. Read more about the causes of testicular lumps and swellings You should see your GP if you notice any lumps, swellings or changes in your testicles. Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and examine your testicles to try to identify the cause of the problem. In some cases you may be referred for further tests, such as an ultrasound scan of your scrotum, to confirm a diagnosis. If you experience sudden or severe pain in your testicles, it's important to contact your GP immediately or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible because urgent treatment may be required. Read more about diagnosing testicular lumps and swellings Find your local GP practice using Scotland's Service Directory. Treatment for testicular lumps and swellings will depend on the underlying cause. Many conditions do not need to be treated if they are not causing any many problems and they are not cancer. Some lumps and swellings will improve over time, and simple measures such as taking over-the-counter painkillers or wearing supportive underwear may be enough to relieve any pain or discomfort in the meantime. Surgery may be recommended to drain away any fluid or remove any solid lumps, if the problem gets worse. Testicular torsion will require urgent surgery to restore blood flow to the affected testicle because the testicle will start to die if not treated within a few hours of the problem developing. Read more about treating testicular lumps and swellings Most testicular lumps and swellings are caused by benign (non-cancerous) conditions, although occasionally they can be a symptom of testicular cancer. It's important to see your GP if you notice a lump or swelling in one of your testicles so they can try to identify the cause and arrange any further tests if necessary. Read more about diagnosing testicular lumps and swellings. Some of the main types of testicular lumps and swellings are outlined below. There are a number of different benign causes of testicular lumps and swellings. Most of these conditions are largely harmless and may not require treatment, although you should seek immediate medical advice if you suspect you have testicular torsion (see below) because it needs to be treated quickly. Varicoceles are soft lumps that usually develop gradually above the testicle and mostly on the left side of the scrotum (the loose sac of skin that contains the testicles). They are sometimes described as feeling like a ""bag of worms"". The exact cause of varicoceles is not clear, but it is widely thought that they occur as the result of abnormalities in the veins in the testicles leading to a build-up of excess blood in the veins, which makes them swell. The size of varicoceles can vary. Some may only be noticeable when you touch them. Others can be larger and seen easily. The side of the scrotum that contains the varicoceles may hang slightly lower than the other side. Besides a lump, varicoceles do not usually cause any other symptoms, although some men and anyone with testicles who have them experience a heavy feeling or aching pain in their scrotum or groin. In a few cases, varicoceles have been linked to infertility. However, there is no evidence that surgically removing them improves your chances of being able to have a baby. Hydroceles are swellings in the scrotum caused by a build-up of fluid. They often affect newborn babies, usually only causing a painless swelling of one or both testicles, although they can sometimes affect older boys, men and anyone with testicles, who may feel some discomfort in the scrotum. During pregnancy, a male baby's testicles develop inside his abdomen (tummy) and they pass down into the scrotum through a passage once they are formed. This passage usually closes before birth, but in some cases it stays open. If the passage remains open, fluid can pass from the abdomen into the scrotum, causing the swelling associated with a hydrocele. In most cases affecting babies, the fluid is absorbed into the surrounding tissue during the child's first year or two of life, and the hydrocele disappears. Hydroceles that develop in men, older boys and anyone with testicles may be caused by inflammation (swelling) of the scrotum resulting from problems such as an injury or infection. An epididymal cyst is a small, smooth fluid-filled swelling that slowly develops in the epididymis (a coil-like structure behind the testicles that helps to store and transport sperm). They are often painless, but the affected testicle may sometimes ache or feel heavy. You may also experience some pain and discomfort if the cyst puts pressure on other structures in or around your testicle. It's not clear what causes epididymal cysts, but they tend to be more common in middle-aged men and anyone with testicles. Epididymo-orchitis is the inflammation of the epididymis as well as the testicle, causing the affected testicle to become swollen, painful and tender over a matter of hours or days. It's not always clear what causes epididymo-orchitis, but the condition is often linked to an infection, including: Epididymo-orchitis can sometimes lead to a reduced sperm count, although this is rarely significant enough to cause infertility. An inguinal hernia occurs when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel, such as the intestine, pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh. The hernia can appear as a swelling or lump in your groin, or as an enlarged scrotum. The lump is often painless, but it can become suddenly and severely painful if the blood supply to the section of organ or tissue trapped in the hernia has become cut off (strangulation). If you think you have a hernia that has become strangulated, you should visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible because urgent surgery may be required. Inguinal hernias occur when the tissue or bowel pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle wall (the abdominal wall) into the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal is a channel through which blood vessels to the testicles pass in men and through which the round ligament (the ligament surrounding the womb) passes in women. Inguinal hernias occur mainly in men. Most are thought to be due to ageing. This is because as you get older, the muscles surrounding your abdomen can become weaker. They can also sometimes appear suddenly due to strain on the abdomen, such as straining on the toilet if you have constipation or carrying and pushing heavy loads. Testicular torsion is a benign but serious condition caused by the spermatic cord (the cord that supplies the testicles with blood) becoming severely twisted. Unlike the other types of benign testicular lumps and swellings, testicular torsion is a medical emergency. You should contact your GP immediately or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible if you suspect you have testicular torsion. Signs and symptoms of testicular torsion include: If the spermatic cord becomes severely twisted, the blood supply for the affected testicle can be interrupted. If this is not treated quickly with surgery, there is a risk of losing the affected testicle. Testicular torsion can occur at any age, but is most common in boys aged 13 to 17 and is rare in men and anyone with testicles over 30. It can also affect newborn babies and even unborn babies in the womb. Most cases happen for no apparent reason, although the problem can occur in boys who are born with an unusually loose spermatic cord and it can develop after an injury to the testicles. You may also be at a higher risk of developing testicular torsion if you have a history of undescended testicles (where a boy is born without both testicles in their scrotum). Although the vast majority of testicular lumps and swellings are benign, a lump in one of the testicles can sometimes be a sign of testicular cancer. Cancer Research UK estimates that fewer than four in every 100 testicular lumps are caused by cancer. Lumps associated with testicular cancer tend to develop slowly on the testicle itself (as opposed to the scrotum) are usually: Unlike many other types of cancer, the risk of testicular cancer does not keep increasing as you get older. The condition is most often diagnosed in boys, men and anyone with testicles between the ages of 15 and 49. It's uncommon in men and anyone with testicles older than this. Read more about the symptoms of testicular cancer Visit your GP if you notice any changes in your testicles. Most testicular lumps are not caused by testicular cancer and many do not necessarily need any treatment, but it's best to get them checked out. Your GP will ask you whether you have: They will also want to examine your testicles to check: Your GP may hold a small light or torch against the lump in your testicle to see whether light passes through it. This can help differentiate between solid lumps and lumps caused by a build-up of fluid (such as hydroceles). Depending on what your GP thinks may be the cause of your symptoms, you may be referred to a specialist such as a urologist (a doctor specialising in conditions affecting the urinary system) for further assessment or your GP may arrange more tests. If testicular torsion is suspected, you will usually be referred to hospital for an urgent assessment to see whether an immediate operation is necessary. Your GP may take a urine sample if they suspect your lump or swelling may be caused by an infection. They may also use a swab (small cotton bud) to collect a sample of cells and fluid from your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). This sample can also be tested to see if you have an infection. You may be referred to a genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinic if it is thought you may have a sexually transmitted infection (STI). An ultrasound scan is used if there is any uncertainty about the cause of your lump or swelling. This is a painless scan that uses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the inside of your scrotum. An ultrasound scan can help give a clearer indication of whether the lump is solid or filled with fluid and can help determine the likelihood of the lump being cancerous. Treatment for your testicular lump or swelling will depend on the underlying cause. Some lumps may not need to be treated at all if they are not causing any problems. In most cases, varicoceles do not require treatment. They usually don't cause other symptoms or long-term problems. Although varicoceles are sometimes associated with infertility, mostly fertility is not affected. There is currently not enough evidence to suggest that treating varicoceles will help improve your chances of having a child. If you have a varicocele that is causing pain or discomfort, taking simple painkillers such as paracetamol and wearing supportive underwear may help initially. Your GP can refer you to a urologist (a doctor specialising in conditions affecting the urinary system) who can discuss the option of surgery with you if your varicocele is still causing your problems. In many cases, a technique called varicocele embolisation can be used to treat problematic varicoceles. A tiny tube is inserted into a vein in your groin or neck and X-ray equipment is used to guide it to the affected veins in your testicles. Metal coils or a special liquid are then passed through the tube to block the affected veins. The blood will then bypass the blocked veins, reducing the swelling associated with the varicocele. Most varicocele embolisation procedures are carried out on an outpatient basis, which means you will not have to stay in hospital overnight. It is usually carried out under local anaesthetic (you'll be awake during the procedure but the affected area will be numbed). Varicocele embolisation is a safe and effective procedure, although you may experience some swelling or bruising where the tube was inserted for a few days afterwards. There is also a small risk of infection, which can be treated with antibiotics, and there is a possibility the varicocele could recur later on. Some varicoceles need surgery to directly tie off or remove the affected veins. This is usually performed under general anaesthetic (where you're asleep) and involves making incisions (cuts) in your groin or abdomen. Hydroceles in newborn babies usually disappear by the time the baby reaches two years of age. Treatment is usually only needed if they persist for longer than this, or cause pain or discomfort. Treatment may also be recommended in boys or adults with a hydrocele that is particularly large or is causing any other symptoms. In such cases, you can be referred to a surgeon to discuss your options. A surgical procedure known as a hydrocelectomy is often recommended for hydroceles. In children, an incision is made in the groin before sealing the passage between the abdomen (tummy) and the scrotum that allows fluid to flow into the scrotum. In adults, the incision is made in the scrotum, the fluid is drained away and the incision is closed using dissolvable stitches. Both procedures are usually carried out under general anaesthetic and most people will be able to return home soon after having the operation. You may experience some discomfort, swelling, and fluid seepage from the wound after the procedure, but this should only last for a few days. Taking simple painkillers and wearing supportive underwear may help reduce any discomfort in the meantime. As with a varicocele embolisation, there is a small risk of infection after a hydrocelectomy and there is a possibility the hydrocele could recur. Epididymal cysts don't normally require treatment because they are usually harmless and don't cause other symptoms. However, if you have a cyst that is getting bigger or is causing any pain or discomfort, you may be referred to a urologist to discuss the possibility of surgery. A procedure to remove an epididymal cyst is carried out under general anaesthetic and involves removing the cysts through a small incision in your scrotum that is sealed with dissolvable stitches. In some cases, it may also be necessary to remove the epididymis (a coil-like structure behind the testicles that helps to store and transport sperm) to prevent another cyst from forming. As with other procedures, you may experience some discomfort, swelling, and fluid seepage from the wound for a few days after the procedure, but this should only last for a few days. Taking simple painkillers and wearing supportive underwear may help reduce any discomfort. There is also a small risk of the wound becoming infected and there is a chance of cysts recurring if the epididymis is not removed. As epididymo-orchitis is often thought to be caused by bacterial infections, such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs), treatment will usually involve a 10-14 day course of antibiotic tablets. If your GP suspects epididymo-orchitis has occurred as a complication of a mumps infection, antibiotics are not used because mumps is caused by a virus. In these cases, the swelling and pain in the testicles will usually resolve within a week or two. Wearing supportive underwear, applying cold or warm compresses to your testicles and taking simple painkillers may help reduce discomfort in the meantime. You may be referred to a surgeon to discuss the option of having an operation to push the bulge back into place and strengthen the weakness in the abdominal wall. This operation will be carried out urgently if there are signs that the blood supply to the tissue forming the lump has become interrupted (strangulated), because this can cause the affected tissue to die. There are two ways that an inguinal hernia repair can be performed: There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. The type of surgery you have will depend on which method suits you and your surgeons experience. With both types of surgery, you should be able to go home the same day or the day after. An inguinal hernia repair is a routine operation with very few risks. Although it is not uncommon for a hernia to recur at some point after surgery. If you have testicular torsion, you will need surgery as soon as possible to untwist the testicle. Permanent injury to the testicle can occur within hours of having testicular torsion, which may affect your fertility or result in the loss of your testicle. Surgery for testicular torsion is carried out under general anaesthetic. The surgeon will make an incision in your scrotum before untwisting the spermatic cord (the cord that supplies the testicles with blood). The testicle (or testicles) will then be stitched to the inside of the scrotum to prevent the spermatic cord twisting again. The longer you wait before having surgery, the higher the risk that your surgeon will not be able to save the trapped testicle. Research has found that when men have surgery within six hours of testicular torsion occurring, nine out of 10 twisted testicles will be saved. However, if the surgery is delayed for 24 hours, only one out of 10 twisted testicles will be saved. If it is not possible to save the affected testicle, the surgeon will need to remove it and seal the spermatic cord. In these cases, another operation can be carried out at a later date to fit a replacement artificial (prosthetic) testicle. If you have been diagnosed with testicular cancer, you will be cared for by a team of clinicians, who will help decide the best treatment for you. This will depend on factors such as the specific type of testicular cancer you have and how far it had spread before it was diagnosed. Surgery to remove the affected testicle will be recommended in most cases and this may sometimes be followed by a course of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. If you want, you can have a prosthetic testicle inserted into your scrotum so that the appearance of your testicles is not greatly affected. In rare cases where it is necessary to remove both testicles, you will become infertile. However, you may be able to bank your sperm before the operation to allow you to father children in the future. Read more about treating testicular cancer"

tinnitus,"Tinnitus is the term for hearing sounds that come from inside your body, rather than from an outside source. It's often described as ""ringing in the ears"", although several sounds can be heard, including: Some people may hear sounds similar to music or singing, and others hear noises that beat in time with their pulse (pulsatile tinnitus). You may also notice that your hearing is not as good as it used to be or you're more sensitive to everyday sounds (hyperacusis). Tinnitus is rarely a sign of a serious underlying condition. For some people it may come and go and only be a minor irritation. However, for some people, it can have a significant impact on everyday life and be very distressing, affect concentration, and cause problems such as difficulty sleeping (insomnia) and depression. In many cases, tinnitus will get better gradually over time, either by disappearing or by the body getting used to it (habituation). But it's important to seek medical advice to see if an underlying cause can be found and treated, and to help you find ways to cope with the problem. You should see your GP if you continually or regularly hear sounds such as buzzing, ringing or humming in your ears. They can examine your ears to see if the problem might be caused by a condition they could easily treat, such as an ear infection or earwax build-up. They can also do some simple checks to see if you have any hearing loss. If necessary, your GP can refer you to a hospital specialist for further tests and treatment. Read more about diagnosing tinnitus. Tinnitus can develop gradually over time or occur suddenly. It's not clear exactly why it happens, but it often occurs along with some degree of hearing loss. Tinnitus is often associated with: However, around one in every three people with tinnitus doesn't have any obvious problem with their ears or hearing. Read more about the causes of tinnitus. Most people have experienced short periods of tinnitus after being exposed to loud noises, such as after a music concert. In the UK, more persistent tinnitus is estimated to affect around six million people (10% of the population) to some degree, with about 600,000 (1%) experiencing it to a severity that affects their quality of life. Tinnitus can affect people of all ages, including children, but is more common in people aged over 65. There's currently no single treatment for tinnitus that works for everyone. However, research to find an effective treatment is continuing. If an underlying cause of your tinnitus can be found, effectively treating it may help improve your tinnitus for example, removing a build-up of earwax might help. If a specific cause can't be found, treatment will focus on helping you manage the condition on a daily basis. This may involve: Read more about how tinnitus is treated. It's not clear exactly what causes tinnitus, but it's thought to be a problem with how the ear hears sounds and how the brain interprets them. Many cases are associated with hearing loss caused by damage to the inner ear, although around one person in every three with the condition doesn't have any obvious problem with their ears or hearing. Sounds pass from the outer ear through to the inner ear, which contains the cochlea and auditory nerve. The cochlea is a coiled, spiral tube containing a large number of sensitive hair cells. The auditory nerve transmits sound signals to the brain. If part of the cochlea is damaged, it will stop sending information to your brain. The brain may then actively ""seek out"" signals from parts of the cochlea that still work. These signals might then become over-represented in the brain, which may cause the sounds of tinnitus. In older people, damage to the cochlea often occurs naturally with age. In younger people, it can be caused by repeated exposure to excessive noise. As well as inner ear damage, there are several other possible causes of tinnitus. These include: Less commonly, tinnitus may develop as a result of: You should see your GP if you have a problem with your hearing, such as hearing ringing or buzzing sounds. They will ask you some questions about your symptoms, such as: They may also want to know whether you're taking any medication that could cause the condition, such as high doses of antibiotics or aspirin. They will examine the outside and inside of your ear to check for obvious problems they may be able to treat, such as an earwax build-up or an ear infection. If you have a pulsatile tinnitus they will also listen to your neck and side of the head with a stethoscope. They might also carry out a simple test of your hearing (free field speech testing and tuning fork tests) and arrange blood tests to look for conditions sometimes associated with tinnitus, such as anaemia (a reduction in red blood cells), diabetes or a problem with your thyroid gland. In some cases, your GP may refer you to a hearing specialist called an audiologist, who can carry out a range of hearing tests and talk to you about the treatments available. Alternatively, you may be referred to the ear, nose and throat (ENT) department of your hospital. An ENT specialist may see you directly or organise a CT scan or MRI scan before arranging an appointment with ENT or Audiology depending on the results. There's not usually a quick fix for tinnitus, but it will often improve gradually over time. A number of treatments are available to help you cope. If your tinnitus is caused by an underlying health condition, treating the condition will help stop or reduce the sounds you hear. For example, if your tinnitus is caused by an earwax build-up, eardrops or ear irrigation may be used. Ear irrigation involves using a pressurised flow of water to remove the earwax. Read more about how an earwax build-up is treated. However, in many cases a cause for tinnitus can't be found, so treatments will be used to help you manage the problem on a daily basis. These are described below. Any degree of hearing loss you have should be addressed because straining to listen can make tinnitus worse. Correcting even fairly minor hearing loss means the parts of the brain involved in hearing don't have to work as hard and therefore don't pay as much attention to the tinnitus. A specialist will test your hearing and recommend appropriate treatment. This could involve having a hearing aid fitted, and occasionally surgery. Improving your hearing will also mean sounds you wouldn't otherwise hear will now be audible, which may help override the sounds of your tinnitus. Read more about treating hearing loss. Tinnitus is often most noticeable in quiet environments. The aim of ""sound therapy"" or ""sound enrichment"" is to fill any silence with neutral sounds to distract you from the sound of tinnitus. This may involve simple measures such as opening a window to hear noises coming from outside, leaving a radio or television on, or listening to sounds on a portable music player. You can get specially-designed sound generators that look similar to a radio. These produce quiet natural sounds, such as leaves rustling in the wind and waves lapping on the shore. White noise generators are similar devices that produce a continuous ""shushing"" sound at a level that's comfortable and soothing. Also available are pillows containing built-in speakers to help distract you from tinnitus when you go to sleep, and small sound-generator devices that fit in your ear like a hearing aid. Some hearing aids have built-in sound generators for people with tinnitus. Understanding tinnitus plays an important part in learning how to cope with the condition and manage it more effectively. Tinnitus counseling is a type of therapy where you work with a healthcare professional to help you learn more about your tinnitus and find ways of coping with it. It's usually carried out by hearing therapists, audiologists (hearing disorder specialists) or doctors. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is often used to treat mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. It's based on the idea that your thoughts affect the way you behave. Treatment aims to retrain the way you think to change your behaviour. This technique can be effectively applied to tinnitus. For example, if your knowledge about tinnitus is limited, you may have certain ideas about it that make you feel anxious and depressed. This can make your tinnitus worse. Changing the way you think about your tinnitus and what you do about it can help reduce your anxiety and enable you to accept the noises, which after a while may become less noticeable. Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) is a special type of therapy that aims to help retrain the way your brain responds to tinnitus so you start to tune the sound out and become less aware of it. The therapy involves a combination of more intensive sound therapy and long-term counselling. TRT is widely available privately and may be available on the NHS for people with very severe or persistent tinnitus. It should only be carried out by someone specially trained in the technique. Some people find self-help techniques useful for managing their tinnitus. These techniques include: Action on Hearing Loss provide further details about support and activities in your local area.

If you have a dental problem you should, in the first instance always telephone the dental practice that you normally attend. If you are not registered with any dental practice then your nearest dental practice will still be able to help. Toothache refers to pain in and around the teeth and jaws that's usually caused by tooth decay. You may feel toothache in many ways. It can come and go or be constant. Eating or drinking can make the pain worse, particularly if the food or drink is hot or cold. The pain can also be mild or severe. It may feel ""sharp"" and start suddenly. It can be worse at night, particularly when you're lying down. A lost filling or broken tooth can sometimes start the pain. It can also sometimes be difficult to decide whether the pain is in your upper or lower teeth. When a lower molar tooth is affected, the pain can often feel like it's coming from the ear. Toothache in other upper teeth may feel like it's coming from the sinuses, the small, air-filled cavities behind your cheekbones and forehead. The area of your jaw close to the infected tooth may also be sore and tender to touch. It's also possible for periodontal disease to give rise to a ""dull"" pain. Periodontal disease is a bacterial infection that affects the soft and hard structures that support the teeth. If you have toothache for more than one or two days, visit your dentist as soon as possible to have it treated. The longer you leave it, the worse it will get. If your toothache isn't treated, the pulp inside your tooth will eventually become infected. This can usually lead to a dental abscess, with severe and continuous throbbing pain. Painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, may reduce the pain and discomfort while you're waiting for an appointment. Children under 16 years of age shouldn't be given aspirin. Find a dentist near you. Toothache occurs when the innermost layer of the tooth (dental pulp) becomes inflamed. The pulp is made up of sensitive nerves and blood vessels. Dental pulp can become inflamed as a result of: There are a number of other conditions that can cause pain similar to toothache, even though the pulp isn't affected. These include: Babies can also experience discomfort when their teeth start to develop. This is known as teething. The type of treatment you have for toothache will depend on the cause of the pain, so your dentist will examine your mouth and may carry out an X-ray to try to identify the problem. If your toothache is caused by tooth decay, your dentist will remove the decayed area and replace it with a filling. If your toothache is caused by a loose or broken filling, the filling will be taken out, any decay will be removed, and a new filling put in place. If the pulp inside your tooth is infected, you may need root canal treatment. This procedure involves removing the infected pulp and then inserting a special type of filling to seal the tooth and prevent reinfection. Your tooth may need to be removed if the toothache can't be treated using these methods or the tooth is wedged between another tooth and your jaw (impacted). The best way to avoid getting toothache and other dental problems is to keep your teeth and gums as healthy as possible. To do this, you should: Make sure you have regular dental check-ups, preferably with the same dentist. The time between check-ups can vary, depending on how healthy your teeth and gums are and your risk of developing future problems. Your dentist will suggest when you should have your next check-up based on your overall oral health. Children should have a dental check-up every six months so tooth decay can be spotted and treated early. Read more about taking care of your teeth and keeping your teeth clean."

vertigo,"Vertigo is a symptom, rather than a condition itself. It's the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning. This feeling may be barely noticeable, or it may be so severe that you find it difficult to keep your balance and do everyday tasks. Attacks of vertigo can develop suddenly and last for a few seconds, or they may last much longer. If you have severe vertigo, your symptoms may be constant and last for several days, making normal life very difficult. Other symptoms associated with vertigo may include: You should see your GP if you have persistent signs of vertigo or it keeps coming back. Your GP will ask about your symptoms and can carry out a simple examination to help determine some types of vertigo. They may also refer you for further tests. Read more about diagnosing vertigo Vertigo is commonly caused by a problem with the way balance works in the inner ear, although it can also be caused by problems in certain parts of the brain. Causes of vertigo may include: Depending on the condition causing vertigo, you may experience additional symptoms, such as a high temperature, ringing in your ears (tinnitus) and hearing loss. Read more about the causes of vertigo Some cases of vertigo improve over time, without treatment. However, some people have repeated episodes for many months, or even years, such as those with Mnire's disease. There are specific treatments for some causes of vertigo. A series of simple head movements (known as the Epley manoeuvre) is used to treat BPPV. Medicines, such as prochlorperazine and some antihistamines, can help in the early stages or most cases of vertigo. Many people with vertigo also benefit from vestibular rehabilitation training (VRT), which is a series of exercises for people with dizziness and balance problems. Read more about treating vertigo Depending on what's causing your vertigo, there may be things you can do yourself to help relieve your symptoms. Your GP or the specialist treating you may advise you to: The term vertigo is often incorrectly used to describe a fear of heights. The medical term for a fear of heights and the dizzy feeling associated with looking down from a high place is ""acrophobia"". Read more about phobias for advice and information. Vertigo is a symptom of several different conditions. There are two types of vertigo, known as peripheral and central, depending on the cause. Peripheral vertigo is the most common type, often caused by a problem with the balance mechanisms of the inner ear. The most common causes include: These causes are explained in more detail below. This is one of the most common causes of vertigo. It can occur during specific head movements, while standing up or bending over, crossing the road, or turning in bed. BPPV involves short, intense, recurrent attacks of vertigo (usually lasting a few seconds to a few minutes). It is often accompanied by nausea, although vomiting is rare. You may also experience your eyes briefly moving uncontrollably (nystagmus). Lightheadedness and a loss of balance can last for several minutes or hours after the attack. BPPV is thought to be caused by small fragments of debris (calcium carbonate crystals), which break off from the lining of the channels in your inner ear. The fragments don't usually cause a problem, unless they get into one of the ear's fluid-filled canals. When your head is still, the fragments sit at the bottom of the canal. However, certain head movements cause them to be swept along the fluid-filled canal, which sends confusing messages to your brain, causing vertigo. BPPV usually affects older people, with most cases occurring in people older than 50 years of age. BPPV may occur for no apparent reason, or it may develop after: Vertigo can sometimes develop after a head injury. If you have symptoms of dizziness or vertigo following a head injury, seek medical attention. Read more about severe head injuries and minor head injuries Labyrinthitis is an inner ear infection that causes a structure deep inside your ear (the labyrinth) to become inflamed. The labyrinth is a maze of fluid-filled channels that control hearing and balance. When the labyrinth becomes inflamed, the information it sends to your brain is different from the information sent from your unaffected ear and your eyes. These conflicting signals cause vertigo and dizziness. Labyrinthitis is usually caused by a viral infection, such as the common cold or flu, which spreads to the labyrinth. Less commonly, it's caused by a bacterial infection. Vertigo caused by labyrinthitis may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, hearing loss, tinnitus and sometimes a high temperature and ear pain. Vestibular neuronitis, also known as vestibular neuritis, is an inner ear condition that causes inflammation of the nerve connecting the labyrinth to the brain. In some cases, the labyrinth itself can also be inflamed. The condition is usually caused by a viral infection. It usually comes on suddenly and can cause other symptoms, such as unsteadiness, nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting (being sick). You won't normally have any hearing problems. It usually lasts a few hours or days, but it may take three to six weeks to settle completely. Severe vertigo is sometimes caused by a rare condition that affects the inner ear, called Mnire's disease. This can cause vertigo, as well as hearing loss, tinnitus and aural fullness (a feeling of pressure in your ear). If you have Mnire's disease, you may experience sudden attacks of vertigo that last for hours or days. The attacks often cause nausea and vomiting. The cause is unknown, but symptoms can be controlled by diet and medication. Rarely, you may need further treatment in the form of surgery. Vertigo may occur as a side effect of some types of medication. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if vertigo is listed as a possible side effect. Don't stop taking prescribed medication without your doctor's advice, but speak to your GP if you're worried about the side effects. They may be able to prescribe an alternative medication. Central vertigo is caused by problems in part of your brain, such as the cerebellum (located at the bottom of the brain) or the brainstem (the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord). Causes of central vertigo include: Your GP will ask about your symptoms and carry out some simple tests to help them make an accurate diagnosis. In some cases, you may be referred for some further tests. Your GP will first want to know: Your GP may also carry out a physical examination to check for signs of conditions that may be causing your vertigo. This could include looking inside your ears and checking your eyes for signs of uncontrollable movement (nystagmus). Your GP may check your balance or try to recreate your symptoms by asking you to move quickly from a sitting to a lying position. Depending on your symptoms, your GP may refer you to a hospital or specialist for further tests. If you have tinnitus (ringing in your ears) or hearing loss, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist, who can carry out some hearing tests. These may include: Read more about how hearing tests are carried out. Videonystagmography (VNG) is sometimes used to check for signs of nystagmus in more detail. Nystagmus can indicate a problem with the organs that help you to balance. During this test, special goggles are placed over your eyes and you'll be asked to look at various still and moving targets. The goggles are fitted with a video camera to record the movements of your eyes. Electronystagmography may also be used, where electrodes are placed around the eye instead of goggles. A caloric test involves running warm or cool water or air into your ear for about 30 seconds. The change in temperature stimulates the balance organ in the ear, allowing the specialist to check how well it's working. This test isn't painful, although it's normal to feel dizzy during the test. This can sometimes continue for a few minutes afterwards. A machine to test your balance may be used to give valuable information about how you are using your vision, proprioception (sensations from your feet and joints) and the input from your ear to maintain balance. This may help to plan your rehabilitation and monitor your treatment. In some cases, a scan of your head may be used to look for the cause of your vertigo, such as an acoustic neuroma (a non-cancerous brain tumour). Usually, either a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan or a computerised tomography (CT) scan is used. An MRI scan uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce a detailed image of the inside of your head, whereas a CT scan uses a series of detailed X-rays to create an image. Treatment for vertigo depends on the cause and severity of your symptoms. During a vertigo attack, lying still in a quiet, darkened room may help to ease any symptoms of nausea and reduce the sensation of spinning. You may be advised to take medication. You should also try to avoid stressful situations, as anxiety can make the symptoms of vertigo worse. Read more about what to do if you're struggling with stress Labyrinthitis is an inner ear infection that causes the labyrinth (a delicate structure deep inside your ear) to become inflamed. It's usually caused by a viral infection and clears up on its own without treatment. In rare cases, where labyrinthitis is caused by a bacterial infection, antibiotics may be prescribed. If you've experienced any hearing loss, your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist or an audiovestibular physician. This is a doctor who specialises in hearing and balance disorders. You may need emergency treatment to restore your hearing. Labyrinthitis may also be treated with vestibular rehabilitation also called vestibular rehabilitation training or VRT (see below). See treating labyrinthitis for more information Vestibular neuronitis, also known as vestibular neuritis, is inflammation of the vestibular nerve (one of the nerves in your ear that's used for balance). It's usually caused by a viral infection. The symptoms of vestibular neuronitis often get better without treatment over several weeks. However, you may need to rest in bed if your symptoms are severe. See your GP if your symptoms get worse or don't start to improve after a week. You may find your balance is particularly affected if you: Avoiding these can help to improve your condition. Vestibular neuronitis can also be treated with vestibular rehabilitation and medication. Like vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) often clears up without treatment after several weeks or months. It's thought that the small fragments of debris in the ear canal that cause vertigo either dissolve or become lodged in a place where they no longer cause symptoms. BPPV can sometimes return. Until the symptoms disappear or the condition is treated, you should: BPPV can be treated using a procedure called the Epley manoeuvre. The Epley manoeuvre involves performing four separate head movements to move the fragments that cause vertigo to a place where they no longer cause symptoms. Each head position is held for at least 30 seconds. You may experience some vertigo during the movements. Your symptoms should improve shortly after the Epley manoeuvre is performed, although it may take up to two weeks for a complete recovery. Return to your GP if your symptoms haven't improved after four weeks. The Epley manoeuvre isn't usually a long-term cure and may need to be repeated. If the Epley manoeuvre doesn't work, or if it's not suitable for example, because you have neck or back problems you can also try Brandt-Daroff exercises. These are a series of movements you can do unsupervised at home. Your GP will need to teach you how to do the exercises. You repeat them three or four times a day for two days in a row. Your symptoms may improve for up to two weeks. Your GP may refer you to a specialist, such as an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist if: In rare cases, where the symptoms of vertigo last for months or years, surgery may be recommended. This may involve blocking one of the fluid-filled canals in your ear. Your ENT specialist can give more advice on this. If your vertigo is caused by Mnire's disease, there are a number of treatment options for both the vertigo and other symptoms caused by the condition. Possible treatments for Mnire's disease include: See treating Mnire's disease for more information Central vertigo is caused by problems in part of your brain, such as the cerebellum (which is located at the bottom of the brain) or the brainstem (the lower part of the brain that's connected to the spinal cord). Causes of central vertigo include migraines and, less commonly, brain tumours. If your GP suspects you have central vertigo, they may organise a scan or refer you to a hospital specialist, such as a neurologist or an ENT (ear, nose and throat specialist) or audiovestibular physician. Treating your migraine should relieve your vertigo if it's caused by a migraine. If the cause of your vertigo is unknown, you may be admitted to hospital if: Alternatively, you may be referred to a specialist, such as: While waiting to see a specialist, you may be treated with medication. Vestibular rehabilitation, also called vestibular rehabilitation training or VRT, is a form of ""brain retraining"". It involves carrying out a special programme of exercises that encourage your brain to adapt to the abnormal messages sent from your ears. During VRT, you keep moving despite feelings of dizziness and vertigo. Your brain should eventually learn to rely on the signals coming from the rest of your body, such as your eyes and legs, rather than the confusing signals coming from your inner ear. By relying on other signals, your brain minimises any dizziness and helps you to maintain your balance. An audiologist (hearing specialist) or a physiotherapist may provide VRT. Your GP may be able to refer you for VRT, although it depends on availability in your area. In some cases, it may be possible to use VRT without specialist help. Research has shown that people with some types of vertigo can improve their symptoms using a self-help VRT booklet. However, you should discuss this with your doctor first. Medication can be used to treat episodes of vertigo caused by vestibular neuronitis or Mnire's disease. It may also be used for central vertigo or vertigo with an unknown cause. The medicines are usually prescribed for 3 to 14 days, depending on which condition they're for. The two medicines that are usually prescribed are: If these medicines are successful in treating your symptoms, you may be given a supply to keep at home, so you can take them the next time you have an episode of vertigo. In some cases you may be advised to take long-term medication, such as betahistine, for conditions like Mnire's disease. Prochlorperazine can help relieve severe nausea and vomiting associated with vertigo. It works by blocking the effect of a chemical in the brain called dopamine. Prochlorperazine can cause side effects, including tremors (shaking) and abnormal or involuntary body and facial movements. It can also make some people feel sleepy. For the full list of possible side effects, check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. Antihistamines can be used to help relieve less severe nausea, vomiting and vertigo symptoms. They work by blocking the effects of a chemical called histamine. Possible antihistamines that may be prescribed include: Like prochlorperazine, antihistamines can also make you feel sleepy. Headaches and an upset stomach are also possible side effects. Check the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine for the full list of possible side effects. A medication called betahistine works in a similar way to antihistamines. It has been used to treat Mnire's disease and may also be used for other balance problems. It may have to be taken for a long period of time. The beneficial effects vary from person to person. If you have vertigo, there are some safety issues to consider. For example: Vertigo could also affect your ability to drive. You should avoid driving if you've recently had episodes of vertigo and there's a chance you may have another episode while you're driving. It's your legal obligation to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) about a medical condition that could affect your driving ability. Visit the GOV.UK website for more information on driving with a disability."

warts-and-verrucas,"Warts are small lumps that often develop on the skin of the hands and feet. Warts vary in appearance and may develop singly or in clusters. Some are more likely to affect particular areas of the body. For example, verrucas are warts that usually develop on the soles of the feet. Warts are non-cancerous, but can resemble certain cancers. Most people will have warts at some point in their life. They tend to affect children and teenagers more than adults. Read more about the symptoms of warts. Warts are caused by an infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). The virus causes an excess amount of keratin, a hard protein, to develop in the top skin layer (epidermis). The extra keratin produces the rough, hard texture of a wart. Read more about the causes of warts. Warts aren't considered very contagious, but they can be caught by close skin-to-skin contact. The infection can also be transmitted indirectly from contaminated objects or surfaces, such as the area surrounding a swimming pool. You are more likely to get infected if your skin is wet or damaged. After you become infected, it can take weeks or even months for a wart or verruca to appear. If you have warts or verrucas you can get advice and treatment directly from a pharmacy. Find your local pharmacy on Scotland's Service Directory. Warts and verrucas aren't usually serious and can be treated by a pharmacist. Your pharmacist may recommend that you see your GP if required. Most types of warts are easy to identify because they have a distinctive appearance. You should always see your pharmacist first if you have a growth on your skin you are unable to identify or are worried about. Your pharmacist will be able to tell if it's a wart simply by looking at it. Where it is on your body and how it affects surrounding skin will also be taken into consideration. Sometimes your pharmacist will advise you to see your GP about a wart. Most warts are harmless and clear up without treatment. The length of time it takes a wart to disappear will vary from person to person. It may take up to 2 years for the viral infection to leave your system and for the wart to disappear. You might decide to treat your wart if it is painful, or in an area that is causing discomfort or embarrassment. Common methods of treatment include: Treatment for warts is not always completely effective, and a wart will sometimes return following treatment. Surgery is not usually recommended for warts. Read more about how warts are treated. Warts are not usually painful, but some types, such as verrucas, may hurt. They can occasionally itch or bleed. There are several different types of warts, all varying in size and shape. If you have a common wart, it will: You may develop one common wart or several. Verrucas usually develop on the soles of the feet. The affected area of skin will: Mosaic warts grow in clusters and form a ""tile-like"" pattern. They often develop on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Periungual warts develop under and around the fingernails or toenails. They: Filiform warts are long and slender in appearance, often developing on the neck or face. It is possible to have between one and several hundred plane warts, which can develop in clusters. They are usually: Plane warts can sometimes develop on the lower legs of women, as the human papilloma virus (HPV) can be spread through shaving. Warts are caused by certain strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV). The virus is present in the skin cells of a wart. HPV is a family of viruses that affects the skin and moist membranes (mucosa) of the body. There are more than 100 different strains of HPV. Different strains are responsible for different types of warts. HPV is passed on through close skin-to-skin contact. It can also be transmitted indirectly by contact with contaminated objects, such as towels, shoes, areas surrounding swimming pools, or the floors of communal changing areas. Warts are thought to be contagious for as long as they are present on your body. The virus is more likely to spread if the skin is wet, soft or has been in contact with a rough surface. Warts can also be spread to other parts of your own body. You can spread the virus if you: This can cause the wart to break up and bleed, making it easier for the virus to spread. You are more vulnerable to verrucas if you have scratches or cuts on the soles of your feet. Warts usually clear up without treatment. However, it can take up to 2 years for the virus to leave your system and the warts to disappear. The length of time it takes for a wart to disappear will vary from person to person. They tend to last longer in older children and adults. In adults and people with a weakened immune system, warts are less likely to clear up on their own or respond well to treatment. Leaving the wart to go away by itself is one option. However, you may want to consider treatment if your wart is painful, in an awkward position, or is causing you distress or embarrassment. Your GP should always refer you to a specialist if you need treatment for a wart on your face. There are a number of treatments available for warts. However, no single treatment is 100% effective, and the wart may return. The aim of treatment is to remove the wart without it returning and without leaving any scarring. Treatments include: Surgery to treat warts is not usually recommended because they often return and further treatment is required. Some treatments may cause side effects such as mild pain, blistering and skin irritation around the wart. Many wart and verruca treatments are available over the counter from pharmacies, including: Salicylic acid is the active ingredient in most of these treatments. It has been shown that salicylic acid is as effective as cryotherapy for treating warts. There is limited evidence available to show which type of salicylic acid treatment (cream, gel, paint or plasters) is most effective. Salicylic acid and other wart treatments also destroy healthy skin, so it is important to protect your skin before applying the treatment. You can use petroleum jelly or a corn plaster to cover the skin around the wart. Before applying the treatment to your wart, use an emery board or pumice stone to file it down a little (avoid sharing the board or pumice stone with others). Repeat this about once a week while you are treating your warts. Each time you treat your wart, soak it in water for about 5 minutes first to soften it, then follow the instructions that come with the medication. You may need to apply the treatment every day for 12 weeks or longer. You should stop the treatment if your skin becomes sore, and seek advice from your pharmacist. Don't use treatments that contain salicylic acid to treat warts on your face. Ask your pharmacist for advice about the best type of treatment. Don't use treatments that contain salicylic acid to treat warts on your face. Ask your pharmacist for advice about the best type of treatment. Consult your pharmacist before using over-the-counter treatments that contain salicylic acid if you have poor circulation for example, if you have a condition like diabetes or peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This is because there is an increased risk of damage to your skin, nerves and tendons. In cryotherapy, liquid nitrogen is applied to your wart for a few seconds to freeze and destroy the affected skin cells. After treatment, a sore blister will form, followed by a scab, which will fall off 7-10 days later. A session of cryotherapy usually takes 5-15 minutes and can be painful. Large warts usually need to be frozen a few times before they clear up. You will probably need to wait a few weeks between each treatment. There are 2 different cryotherapy methods. Liquid nitrogen may be sprayed directly onto the wart, or it may be applied using a stick with cotton wool on the tip. This second method is often preferred for treatment around the eyes or for small children. Cryotherapy may be recommended if you have a wart on your face. This is because the risk of irritation is lower than when using salicylic acid or duct tape. Cryotherapy is not usually recommended to treat young children because they may find the treatment too painful. It may also be difficult for them to stay in the same position while having the treatment. If cryotherapy hasn't been successful within 3 months, further treatments aren't likely to be effective. Possible side effects of cryotherapy include: Cryotherapy is sometimes carried out at GP surgeries or at hospital skincare clinics. However, it may not be available on the NHS in all areas of the country. A very cold spray (dimethyl ether propane) is also available from pharmacies, which you can apply yourself. You should avoid using this spray on your face. Evidence suggests these sprays are not as effective as cryotherapy using liquid nitrogen. Warts can also be treated using chemical treatments available on prescription. The treatments contain chemicals such as: These chemicals are applied to the warts to kill affected skin cells. Potential side effects include the skin being stained brown (with glutaraldehyde) and burns to the surrounding skin (with silver nitrate). If the above treatments do not clear warts then other methods may be tried such as: These treatments may not be available on the NHS. If you are pregnant and have warts, your pharmacist may recommend using salicylic acid, cryotherapy or duct tape. Salicylic acid can be used to treat warts during pregnancy, as long as it is used on a small area for a limited period of time. Most people will be infected by the human papilloma virus (HPV) at some point in their life and develop warts. However, there are steps you can take to lower your chances of getting warts and prevent spreading them to others, if you have them. If you have a wart or verruca, you should cover it up when taking part in communal activities. For example, you should:"
