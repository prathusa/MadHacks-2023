## Inspiration

Doctors must rely on patient-reported symptom data prone to human error and forgetfulness. This application can alleviate and potentially remove some of those pain points by allowing the patient to record and report their symptoms in real-time.

## What it does

Our application is designed to help patients track and log their symptoms for more accurate diagnosis and treatment. By providing a simple and intuitive way to input symptoms, our app enables patients to communicate important information to their healthcare providers and improve the accuracy of their medical care.

With our app, patients can track the type, severity, and frequency of their symptoms in real-time and add notes or other important details to provide a comprehensive picture of their health. This data can help healthcare providers identify patterns in symptoms and make more informed decisions about diagnosis and treatment.

Our application is designed to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers, providing a more seamless and efficient communication channel. By tracking symptoms and sharing data in real-time, our app helps to facilitate a more collaborative and proactive approach to healthcare.

## How we built it

We used Next.js for the frontend and Supabase to host our PostgreSQL database backend.

## Challenges we ran into

- Learning to use PostgreSQL
- Learning TailwindCSS and routing in React
- Finding a free service to host our PostgreSQL database(settled on Supabase)
- Initially used vanilla React before switching to Next.js to allow more flexibility in our workflow

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Potential for scaling and growth
- Shipping a working product

## What we learned

- PostgreSQL
- Supabase
- Routing in React
- TailwindCSS

## What's next for Patient Health Log

Going forward, we want to be able to equip the user with personalized insights and recommendations based on their symptom data. For example, it may suggest lifestyle changes or activities that can help manage their symptoms, or prompt them to seek medical attention if their symptoms reach a certain threshold.
